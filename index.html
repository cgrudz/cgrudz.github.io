    Welcome to the home for my professional and creative interests. I was awarded my PhD in Applied Mathematics
    from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May 2016 and I am now a postdoctoral researcher at the
    <a href="https://nersc.no" target="blank"> Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center </a> developing dimensional 
    reduction methodology for prediction with big data in the environmental sciences.

    I spent most of my years in Eugene, Oregon before moving to North Carolina, and now Norway.  I am an avid traveller, a soul, jazz and
    post-punk devotee and DIY motorcycle enthusiast. I like reading and re-reading Foucault and Zhuang Zhou.
