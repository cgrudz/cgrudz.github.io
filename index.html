        Welcome to my website, this is the home for my professional and creative interests. I was awarded my PhD in Applied Mathematics
        from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May 2016 and I will begin a postdoctoral research appointment at the
        <a href="https://nersc.no"> Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensning Center </a> Starting in August 2016.
