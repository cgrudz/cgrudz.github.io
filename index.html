<h2>Short biography</h2>
<p>
    I was awarded my PhD in Applied Mathematics
    from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May 2016.  I am now a postdoctoral researcher at the
    <a href="https://nersc.no" target="blank"> Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center</a>.  During Fall
    Semester 2018 I will be a visitor at <a href="http://cerea.enpc.fr/en/index.html" target="blank">CEREA</a>, a Joint Laboratory of &Eacutecole des Ponts ParisTech/EDF R&ampD.
    Beginning Spring Semester 2019, I will join the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/math" target="blank">University of Nevada, Reno</a> as an assistant professor of statistics.
</p>
<p>I spent most of my years in Eugene, Oregon before moving around the world.  I am a soul, jazz and
     post-punk devotee and DIY motorcycle and Linux enthusiast. I like reading and re-reading Foucault and Zhuang Zhou.
