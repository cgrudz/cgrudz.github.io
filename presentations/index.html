<p>
   I have been searching for a solid alternative to beamer presentations in LaTeX, and to Libre Office, for my mathematical presentations.
   The main challenge is finding a presentation platform that can handle heavy usage of LaTeX and bibtex, while having a better presentation
   feel than standard beamer.  This has led my to try <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/", target="blank">Reveal.js</a> as an option.
   This is an ongoing experiment, where I will try hosting a presentation template on my website to test its viability as my primary scientific
   presentation platform.  Along with vanila Reveal.js, I will try converting 
   <a href="https://jupyter.org/", target="blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a> into Reveal.js as a possiblitity.
