<h2> Data Assimilation </h2>
<p>
    Chaotic dynamics are often described in terms of the “butterfly effect” where a minor change in the initialization of a model, 
    tantamount to the flap of a butterfly wing, produces a radically different outcome over the course of a model run.
    It is well known in the weather forecasting community that the uncertainty in prediction conforms to the dominant system instabilities, 
    which are of much lower dimension than that of the full model.  My research interests lie primarily in the intersection of data, 
    stability and prediction, studying how dynamic instability impacts the evolution of uncertainty for predictive models.
    My postdoctoral appointment at NERSC is funded by the <a href="https://www.nersc.no/project/redda" target='blank'>
    Reduced subspace in big data treatment: A new paradigm for efficient geophysical Data Assimilation (REDDA)</a> project, in which 
    I am studying extensions of previous results, with my collaborators, to imperfect model settings and non-linear systems.

<h2>Stability Analysis</h2>
<p> 
    While PDEs are not generally analytically solvable, coherent states such as waves and solitons can provide useful qualitative
    information about the system of equations.  Stable states in particular attract other model solutions in their asymptotic state,
    and provide model solutions that are robust in realistic, noisy settings.  Determining the stability of coherent states is often
    performed with Evans function analysis, and in addition my work on data assimilation, my graduate thesis proved a novel 
    formualtion of the Evans function for reaction diffusion equations.

<h2>Smart Grids</h2>
<p>
    As part of my graduate research training, I was an intern at Los Alamos National Labs where I performed data analysis and network reduction
    for electric grid transmission networks.  I am broadly interested in the application of data assimilation and machine learning techniques
    for parameter and state estimation for dynamic electric grid models; the expansion of renewable generation has brought many opportunities but
    also uncertainties in electric generation, and data driven prediction techniques offer methodology for optimization and grid security
    under uncertainty.

<h3> Visualizations </h3>
<p>
    The following visualizations demonstrate the force directed layout of the fully reduced power grid network model, where nodes represent repelling bodies
   and edges represent springs.  We randomly initialize the positions for the triangle reduced network and run the positions to a stabilized configuration.  Random initial
  positions are shown in the first figure and a stabilized result is shown in the second.  Finally, we overlay the degree two reduction (performed before the triangle reductions)
 on the positions for the stabilized triangle reduction.  Enabling the physics on the third figure demonstrates the declustering of the degree two reduced network from the
triangle reduced network, as shown in the manuscript.
