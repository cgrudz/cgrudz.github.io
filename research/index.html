<h2> Data Assimilation </h2>
<p>
    Chaotic dynamics are often described in terms of the “butterfly effect” where a minor change in the initialization of a model, 
    tantamount to the flap of a butterfly wing, produces a radically different outcome over the course of a model run.
    It is well known in the weather foreecasting community that uncertainty in prediction conforms to the dominant system instabilities, 
    which are of much lower dimension than that of the full model.  My research interests lie primarily in the intersection of data, 
    stability and prediction, studying how dynamic instability impacts the evolution of uncertainty for predictive models.
    My postdoctoral appointment at NERSC is funded by the <a href="https://www.nersc.no/project/redda">Reduced subspace in big data treatment:
    A new paradigm for efficient geophysical Data Assimilation (REDDA)</a> project, in which I will be building on the research begun during 
    my graduate study with my collaborators.

<h2>Stability Analysis</h2>
<p> 
    While PDEs are not generally analytically solvable, coherent states such as waves and solitons can provide useful qualitative
    information about the system of equations.  Stable states in particular attract other model solutions in their asymptotic state,
    and provide model solutions that are robust in realistic, noisy settings.  Determining the stability of coherent states is often
    performed with Evans function analysis, and in addition my work on data assimilation, my graduate thesis proved a novel 
    formualtion of the Evans function for reaction diffusion equations.

<h2>Smart Grids</h2>
<p>
    As part of my graduate research training, I was an intern at Los Alamos National Labs where I performed data analysis and network reduction
    for electric grid transmission networks.  I am broadly interested in the application of data assimilation and machine learning techniques
    for parameter and state estimation for dynamic electric grid models; the expansion of renewable generation has brought many benefits but
    also uncertainties in electric generation, and data driven prediction techniques offer methodology for optimization and grid security
    under uncertainty.

    My final product at Los Alamos was to produce visualizations of the reduced model I produced over the summer in 
    <a href="https://visjs.org/" target="blank"> Vis.js</a>, an open source javascript visualization library.  Links to the visualizations
    and work summary are below---note that the visualizations are interactive and you can zoom, manipulate and change parameter settings.
