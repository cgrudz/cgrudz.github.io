<p>
I am passionate about global math and science literacy, and promoting meaningful discussions on climate, energy and sustainability. 
My graduadte study was funded by the <a href="https://mcrn.hubzero.org/" target="blank">Math and Climate Research Network</a> and I continue
to support the organizational cyber-infrastructure as a volunteer Hub administrator.  As a Hub admin for MCRN, I lead trainings and tutorials
to facilitate remote scientific colloaboration, and I maintain educational and research oriented resources for the MCRN libraries to 
promote broader impacts.

<p>
   The MCRN Hub infrastructure is free for educators and researchers in mathematics and climate to use for online collaboration, hosting, and
   presenting results. If you are interested in employing the tools on the MCRN hub for your work, feel free to contact me.
