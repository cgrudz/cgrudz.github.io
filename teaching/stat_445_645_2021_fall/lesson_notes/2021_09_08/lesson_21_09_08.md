## Control flow


* Often when we're coding we want to control the flow of our actions -- this often occurs when we write a <strong>script</strong> with detailed instructions.

* This can be done by setting actions to occur only if a condition or a set of conditions are met.

  * Alternatively, we can also set an action to occur a particular number of times.

* There are several ways you can control flow in R.

  * How to use control flow in R will be the first topic we will outline in the following.

========================================================
### Basic control flow

* For conditional statements, the most commonly used approaches are the constructs `if` and `else`:


```r
# if
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}

# if ... else
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
```

* This kind of binary logic is at the heart of classical (non-quantum) computing and used effectively can be used to create rich sets of commands.

* `if` and `else` can be chained together to handle a wide variety of cases, and even to handle when we encounter errors.


========================================================
### An example

* Say, for example, that we want R to print a message if a variable `x` has a particular value:


```r
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
}

x
```

```
[1] 8
```

* The print statement does not appear in the console because x is not greater than 10. 

========================================================
### An example continued


* To print a different message for numbers less than 10, we can add an `else` statement.


```r
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```

```
[1] "x is less than 10"
```

* You can also test multiple conditions by using `else if`.


```r
x <- 8

if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5, but less than 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

```
[1] "x is greater than 5, but less than 10"
```

* If we needed to sort some data into sub-categories based on a `TRUE` or `FALSE` statements, `if`, `else if` and `else` will equip us to handle complex cases.

========================================================
### An example continued

* **Remember:** when R evaluates the condition inside `if()` statements, it is looking for a `logical` element, i.e., `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 


```r
x  <-  4 == 3
if (x) {
  "4 equals 3"
} else {
  "4 does not equal 3"          
}
```

```
[1] "4 does not equal 3"
```

* As we can see, the not equal message was printed because the vector x is `FALSE`


```r
x <- 4 == 3
x
```

```
[1] FALSE
```

========================================================
### Advanced details on conditions


* Note: the `if()` function only accepts singular (of length 1) inputs, and therefore returns an error when you use it with a standard vector. 

  * The `if()` function will still run, but will only evaluate the condition in the first element of the vector. 

* To use the `if()` function, you need to make sure your input is  singular (of length 1).  


========================================================
### Advanced details on conditions


* The in `ifelse()` function  in `R` accepts both `if()` and `else()` statements simultaneously as structured in the previous example.

* This function accepts both singular and vector inputs and is structured as  follows: 


```r
# ifelse function 
ifelse(condition is true, perform action, perform alternative action) 
```

* The first argument is the condition or a set of conditions to be met;
 
* the second argument is the statement that is evaluated when the condition is `TRUE`;

* and the third statement is the statement that is evaluated when the condition is `FALSE`.  
 

========================================================
### An example

* Consider the following example of the `ifelse` function;

* <b>Q:</b> can you hypothesize  what will be the output of this statement?


```r
y <- -3
ifelse(y < 0, "y is a negative number", "y is either positive or zero")
```

```
[1] "y is a negative number"
```



========================================================

## Repeating operations

* In many instances in data analysis, we will need to repeatedly perform some operation.

* This could be as simple as repeatedly opening a long list of files, taking out a line of data that is needed from each, and compiling all the data into a dataframe.

* More complex analysis also often requires complex instructions to be delivered to software in R.

* If you want to iterate over a set of values, when the order of iteration is important, and perform the
same operation on each, a `for()` loop will do the job.


*  However, for performance  `for()` loops should be avoided unless the order of iteration is
important: 

  * i.e. the calculation at each iteration depends on the results of  previous iterations. 
  
* If the order of iteration is not important, then vectorized alternatives, such as the `purr` package, should be used whenever possible. 


========================================================
### An example of `for` loops


* The basic structure of a `for()` loop is:  


```r
for (iterator in set of values) {
  do a thing
}
```



* For example:


```r
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```

```
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
[1] 6
[1] 7
[1] 8
[1] 9
[1] 10
```

* Notice that the `1:10` bit creates a vector on the fly; you can iterate over any other vector as well.

========================================================
### Nested for loops

* We can use a `for()` loop nested within another `for()` loop to iterate over two things at once.


```r
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
```

```
[1] "1 a"
[1] "1 b"
[1] "1 c"
[1] "1 d"
[1] "1 e"
[1] "2 a"
[1] "2 b"
[1] "2 c"
[1] "2 d"
[1] "2 e"
[1] "3 a"
[1] "3 b"
[1] "3 c"
[1] "3 d"
[1] "3 e"
[1] "4 a"
[1] "4 b"
[1] "4 c"
[1] "4 d"
[1] "4 e"
[1] "5 a"
[1] "5 b"
[1] "5 c"
[1] "5 d"
[1] "5 e"
```



========================================================
### Nested for loops


* We notice in the output that when the first index (`i`) is set to 1, the second  index (`j`) iterates through its full set of indices. 

* Once the indices of `j` have been iterated through, then `i` is incremented. This process continues  until the last index has been used for each `for()` loop.  

* Rather than printing the results, we could write the loop output to a new object.


```r
output_vector <- c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    temp_output <- paste(i, j)
    output_vector <- c(output_vector, temp_output)
  }
}
```

* Our `output_vector` from the last slide thus prints as

```r
output_vector
```

```
 [1] "1 a" "1 b" "1 c" "1 d" "1 e" "2 a" "2 b" "2 c" "2 d" "2 e" "3 a" "3 b"
[13] "3 c" "3 d" "3 e" "4 a" "4 b" "4 c" "4 d" "4 e" "5 a" "5 b" "5 c" "5 d"
[25] "5 e"
```


========================================================
### Nested for loops

* The last approach can be useful, but 'growing your results' (building the result object incrementally) is computationally inefficient, 

  * we should avoid this style of programming when iterating through a lot of values.

* Computers are very bad at handling this efficiently, so your calculations can very quickly slow to a crawl. 

* It's much better to define an empty results object before hand of appropriate dimensions, rather  than initializing an empty object without dimensions.

* If you know the end result will be stored in a matrix like above, create an empty matrix with 5 row and 5 columns, then at each iteration store the results in the appropriate location.


========================================================
### Pre-allocation of memory


* A better way is to define your (empty) output object before filling in the values.

* For this example, it looks more involved, but is still more efficient.


```r
output_matrix <- matrix(nrow=5, ncol=5)
j_vector <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
    temp_j_value <- j_vector[j]
    temp_output <- paste(i, temp_j_value)
    output_matrix[i, j] <- temp_output
  }
}
output_vector2 <- as.vector(output_matrix)
```


* This new output prints as


```r
output_vector2
```

```
 [1] "1 a" "2 a" "3 a" "4 a" "5 a" "1 b" "2 b" "3 b" "4 b" "5 b" "1 c" "2 c"
[13] "3 c" "4 c" "5 c" "1 d" "2 d" "3 d" "4 d" "5 d" "1 e" "2 e" "3 e" "4 e"
[25] "5 e"
```


========================================================
###  While loops


* Sometimes you will find yourself needing to repeat an operation as long as a certain condition is met, or until some condition is met, but may not be met until after an unknown number of iterations.

* You can do this with a `while()` loop.


```r
while(this condition is true){
  do a thing
}
```

* R will interpret a condition being met as "TRUE".


* A loop can be written to perform an action for a "FALSE" condition, until it is becomes "TRUE" by using the logical inverse `!`.

```r
while(! this condition is False){
  do a thing
}
```



========================================================
###  While loops example

* As an example, here's a while loop that generates random numbers from a uniform distribution (the `runif()` function)
between 0 and 1 until it gets one that's less than 0.1.

* We will set a random seed set for reproducibility of the analysis.


```r
set.seed(10)
z <- 1
while(z > 0.1){
  z <- runif(1)
  cat(z, "\n")
}
```

```
0.5074782 
0.3067685 
0.4269077 
0.6931021 
0.08513597 
```


* Even though this is a while loop that terminates on a random condition (`z>1`), the seed means that each time we re-run the code we will get the same (pseudo)-random result.


========================================================
###  While loops example


* Now that we have learned a bit about `while()` loops, lets consider the following question

* <b>Q:</b> what do you think will be the output of the below chunk of code?


```r
z <- 1
while( z>= 1){
  z <- z+1
  cat(z, "\n")
}
```

* <b>A:</b> the loop will never terminate based on its logical condition, as `z`$\geq 1$ for every iteration.

  * at best, we might hope that this will throw an error to the programmer when `z` becomes too large to store in memory. 

* This shows how `while()` loops will not always be appropriate. 

* You have to be particularly careful that you don't end up stuck in an infinite loop because your condition is always met and hence the while statement never terminates.

* In this case we have an obvious error with this loop, but these conditions can be much more subtle and therefore we need to think about how they are satisfied.
