<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:

  * More on subsetting data
  * Dataframes
  * Vectorization
  

========================================================

## Factor subsetting

* Now that we've explored the different ways to subset vectors, how do we subset the other data structures?

* Factor subsetting works the same way as vector subsetting.

```r
f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "d"))
f[f == "a"]
```

```
[1] a a
Levels: a b c d
```

```r
f[f %in% c("b", "c")]
```

```
[1] b c c
Levels: a b c d
```

```r
f[1:3]
```

```
[1] a a b
Levels: a b c d
```



========================================================
## Factor subsetting -- continued

* Skipping elements will not remove the level even if no more of that category exists in the factor:

```r
f[-3]
```

```
[1] a a c c d
Levels: a b c d
```

========================================================

## Matrix subsetting

* Matrices are also subsetted using the `[` function. In this case it takes two arguments: the first applying to the rows, the second to its columns:

```r
set.seed(1)
m <- matrix(rnorm(6*4), ncol=4, nrow=6)
m[3:4, c(3,1)]
```

```
            [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  1.12493092 -0.8356286
[2,] -0.04493361  1.5952808
```

* You can leave the first or second arguments blank to retrieve all the rows or columns respectively:

```r
m[, c(3,4)]
```

```
            [,1]        [,2]
[1,] -0.62124058  0.82122120
[2,] -2.21469989  0.59390132
[3,]  1.12493092  0.91897737
[4,] -0.04493361  0.78213630
[5,] -0.01619026  0.07456498
[6,]  0.94383621 -1.98935170
```

========================================================
### Matrix subsetting -- continued

* If we only access one row or column, R will automatically convert the result
to a vector:

```r
m[3,]
```

```
[1] -0.8356286  0.5757814  1.1249309  0.9189774
```

* If you want to keep the output as a matrix, you need to specify a *third* argument;
`drop = FALSE`:


```r
m[3, , drop=FALSE]
```

```
           [,1]      [,2]     [,3]      [,4]
[1,] -0.8356286 0.5757814 1.124931 0.9189774
```

========================================================
### Matrix subsetting -- continued

* Unlike vectors, if we try to access a row or column outside of the matrix,
R will throw an error:


```r
m[, c(3,6)]
```

```
Error in m[, c(3, 6)]: subscript out of bounds
```

* When dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, each argument to `[`  corresponds to a dimension. For example, a 3D array, the first three  arguments correspond to the rows, columns, and depth dimension.


========================================================
### Matrix subsetting -- continued

* Because matrices are vectors, we can also subset using only one argument:

```r
m[5]
```

```
[1] 0.3295078
```


* This usually isn't useful, and often confusing to read. However it is useful to note that matrices are laid out in *column-major format* by default. 

* That is the elements of the vector are arranged column-wise:


```r
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6
```


========================================================
### Matrix subsetting -- continued

* If you wish to populate the matrix by row, use `byrow=TRUE`:


```r
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
```

* Matrices can also be subsetted using their rownames and column names instead of their row and column indices.

========================================================

## List subsetting

* Now we'll introduce some new subsetting operators. There are three functions used to subset lists. We've already seen these when learning about atomic vectors and matrices:  `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

* Using `[` will always return a list. If you want to *subset* a list, but not *extract* an element, then you will likely use `[`.


```r
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist[1]
```

```
$a
[1] "Software Carpentry"
```

* This returns a *list with one element*.

* To extract individual elements of a list, you need to use the double-square bracket function: `[[`.


```r
xlist[[1]]
```

```
[1] "Software Carpentry"
```


========================================================
### List subsetting -- continued

* You can't extract more than one element at once:

```r
xlist[[1:2]]
```

```
Error in xlist[[1:2]]: subscript out of bounds
```

* Nor use it to skip elements:

```r
xlist[[-1]]
```

```
Error in xlist[[-1]]: invalid negative subscript in get1index <real>
```

* But you can use names to both subset and extract elements:

```r
xlist[["a"]]
```

```
[1] "Software Carpentry"
```

========================================================
### List subsetting -- continued

* The `$` function is a shorthand way for extracting elements by name:

```r
xlist$data
```

```
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
```

========================================================
## Data frames

* Remember the data frames are lists underneath the hood, so similar rules apply. 

* However they are also two dimensional objects:

  * `[` with one argument will act the same way as for lists, where each list element corresponds to a column. 
  
  * The resulting object will be a data frame:


```r
require(gapminder)
head(gapminder[3])
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 1
   year
  <int>
1  1952
2  1957
3  1962
4  1967
5  1972
6  1977
```

* Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:


```r
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
```

```
[1] 28.801 30.332 31.997 34.020 36.088 38.438
```

========================================================
### Data frames -- continued


* The `$` symbol provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:


```r
head(gapminder$year)
```

```
[1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977
```

* With two arguments, `[` behaves the same way as for matrices:


```r
gapminder[1:3,]
```

```
# A tibble: 3 x 6
  country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
  <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.
3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
```

========================================================
### Data frames -- continued


* If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because the elements are mixed types):


```r
gapminder[3,]
```

```
# A tibble: 1 x 6
  country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
  <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
```

* But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can be changed with the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).



========================================================
### Data frames -- continued


* Most of R's functions are vectorized, meaning that the function will operate on all elements of a vector without needing to loop through and act on each element one at a time. 

* This makes writing code more concise, easy to read, and less error prone.



```r
x <- 1:4
x * 2
```

```
[1] 2 4 6 8
```

* The multiplication happened to each element of the vector.

========================================================
## Vectorization

* We can also add two vectors together:


```r
y <- 6:9
x + y
```

```
[1]  7  9 11 13
```

* Each element of `x` was added to its corresponding element of `y`:


```r
x:  1  2  3  4
    +  +  +  +
y:  6  7  8  9
---------------
    7  9 11 13
```

* Comparison operators, logical operators, and many functions are also vectorized:


```r
x > 2
```

```
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
a <- x > 3  # or, for clarity, a <- (x > 3)
a
```

```
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```

========================================================

## Vectorization and performance

* R, while having the benefit of being an easy-to-learn language with powerful software, is not especially fast.

* For many users, this doesn't pose an obstacle however as the vectorization of the language can actually make many computations in R competitive.

  * When a mathematic operation or function is run as a vectorized operation, the computer calls underlying C code that has been optimized for performance.
  
  * This is the same performance-gain technique that is used in, e.g., MATLAB and Python.

* Though we have not discussed ```FOR``` loops yet, we will mention now that in general you should always try to write your operations vector-wise instead of with ```FOR``` loops in R.


========================================================

### A remark on element-wise vs. matrix multiplication

* <strong>Very important:</strong> the operator `*` gives you element-wise multiplication!
* To do matrix multiplication, we need to use the `%*%` operator:


```r
m %*% matrix(1, nrow=4, ncol=1)
```

```
            [,1]
[1,]  0.06095586
[2,] -0.69883054
[3,]  1.78406103
[4,]  2.02709511
[5,]  1.89966366
[6,] -1.47614063
```

```r
matrix(1:4, nrow=1) %*% matrix(1:4, ncol=1)
```

```
     [,1]
[1,]   30
```
