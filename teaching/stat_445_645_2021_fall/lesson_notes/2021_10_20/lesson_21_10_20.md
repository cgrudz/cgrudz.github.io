========================================================
### Solving a linear system of equations

* An inverse in the R language can be found from a more general problem called a <b>linear inverse problem</b>:
  
  $$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$$
  
* In the above, we assume that the <b style="color:#1b9e77">vector $\mathbf{x}$ is of interest but unknown</b>.
  
  * On the other hand, we assume that <b style="color:#d95f02">$\mathbf{A}$ is a known relationship between $\mathbf{x}$ and the observed vector $\mathbf{b}$</b>.
  
* If there are <strong>no dependencies in the relationship defined by the columns of $\mathbf{A}$</strong>, then there is a <b>unique relationship</b> that transfers the unobserved $\mathbf{x}$ to the observed variables $\mathbf{b}$.

* Being able to invert this relationship, we find
  
  $$\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{b}.$$
  

* The way to implement such a procedure in R is with the `solve()` function.

* If a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is supplied alone, this computes the inverse $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ if it exists.

  * If a vector $\mathbf{b}$ is supplied additionally, then this solves for $\mathbf{x}$ as above.
  
========================================================
### Solving a linear system of equations example

* We will use the `solve()` function with `my_matrix` (as generated last time) to demonstrate:


```r
set.seed(0)
my_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(16), nrow=4, ncol=4)
solve(my_matrix) %*% my_matrix
```

```
              [,1]         [,2]          [,3]          [,4]
[1,]  1.000000e+00 1.942890e-16  0.000000e+00 -5.551115e-17
[2,] -2.220446e-16 1.000000e+00  0.000000e+00  0.000000e+00
[3,] -2.220446e-16 1.665335e-16  1.000000e+00 -5.551115e-17
[4,]  0.000000e+00 2.775558e-16 -4.440892e-16  1.000000e+00
```

```r
my_matrix %*% solve(my_matrix)
```

```
              [,1]         [,2]          [,3]          [,4]
[1,]  1.000000e+00 1.110223e-16  0.000000e+00 -2.220446e-16
[2,] -2.775558e-17 1.000000e+00 -2.220446e-16  4.996004e-16
[3,]  0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00  1.000000e+00  5.551115e-17
[4,] -5.551115e-17 0.000000e+00  3.330669e-16  1.000000e+00
```

* Notice that the off diagonal elements are not exactly but approximately zero.

========================================================
### Solving a linear system of equations example


* We can also solve the linear inverse problem,


```r
my_matrix %*% solve(my_matrix, 1:4)
```

```
     [,1]
[1,]    1
[2,]    2
[3,]    3
[4,]    4
```
 
* This is representing the equation
 $$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A}  \left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}\right) = \mathbf{b}.$$



========================================================
## Matrix spectrum and norms

* Notice the dimensionality in the previous linear inverse problem,

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n} & & \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n \times 1 } & & \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times 1}
  \end{align}$$

* That is to say, $\mathbf{A}$ takes $\mathbf{x}$ from where it lies in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to another vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

* Generally, when we consider a square matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, the transformation it represents is from the space $\mathbb{R}^n$ back to itself.

* A special notion exists for such transformations, when the transformation only scales the existing values.

* Consider the diagonal matrix,


```r
diag(1:3)
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    0    0
[2,]    0    2    0
[3,]    0    0    3
```

```r
diag(1:3) %*% c(1, 0, 0)
```

```
     [,1]
[1,]    1
[2,]    0
[3,]    0
```

========================================================
### Matrix spectrum and norms continued

* Now we consider


```r
diag(1:3) %*% c(0, 1, 0)
```

```
     [,1]
[1,]    0
[2,]    2
[3,]    0
```

```r
diag(1:3) %*% c(0, 0, 1)
```

```
     [,1]
[1,]    0
[2,]    0
[3,]    3
```

* In each case, the matrix `diag(1:3)` had the property that it sent the vector back to a re-scaled copy of itself.

* This is because each of the vectors were distinct eigenvectors for the matrix.

========================================================
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

* If a nonzero vector $\mathbf{x}$ has the property that,
  
  $$\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} =\lambda \mathbf{x}$$

  then $\mathbf{x}$ is said to be an eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}$ associated to the eigenvalue $\lambda$.
  
* Diagonal matrices are ones that have an entire coordinate system composed of eigenvectors.

  * Certain non-diagonal matrices can be transformed into diagonal matrices by finding such a coordinate system.
  
*  Notice now that,
 
  $$\begin{align}
  & \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} =\lambda \mathbf{x} \\
  \Leftrightarrow & \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} - \lambda \mathbf{x} = 0 \\
  \Leftrightarrow & \left(\mathbf{A}  - \lambda \mathbf{I}_n\right) \mathbf{x} = 0 \\
  \end{align}$$
  
* This means that $\mathbf{x}$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\left(\mathbf{A}  - \lambda \mathbf{I}_n\right)$ associated to the zero eigenvalue.

  * Particularly, this means that there is a linear dependence in $\left(\mathbf{A}  - \lambda \mathbf{I}_n\right)$ and 
  
  $$\mathrm{det} \left(\mathbf{A}  - \lambda \mathbf{I}_n\right) = 0.$$
  
* The above fact is a basic property that allows us to solve for eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.

========================================================
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

* In the R language, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed as follows:


```r
eigen(my_matrix)
```

```
eigen() decomposition
$values
[1] -0.312062+1.564758i -0.312062-1.564758i  1.387185+0.000000i
[4] -0.687975+0.000000i

$vectors
                      [,1]                  [,2]           [,3]         [,4]
[1,] -0.3449514+0.0145144i -0.3449514-0.0145144i -0.62691105+0i 0.2303783+0i
[2,]  0.5832284+0.0000000i  0.5832284+0.0000000i -0.44282830+0i 0.6601861+0i
[3,]  0.2216425+0.4402345i  0.2216425-0.4402345i -0.63480339+0i 0.3408087+0i
[4,] -0.2440101+0.4880265i -0.2440101-0.4880265i -0.08893981+0i 0.6284342+0i
```

* Notice that some of the eigenvalue are actually complex numbers, and the eigenvectors are complex vectors.

  * This is due to the fact that such a coordinate system to transform a matrix into a representation in eigenspaces may only exist in complex coordinates.
  
========================================================
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

* Instead consider,


```r
A <- matrix(1:16, nrow=4, ncol=4)
eigen(diag(1:3))
```

```

```

```r
eigen(A)
```

```

          [,1]        [,2]       [,3]        [,4]
[1,] 0.4140028  0.82289268 -0.5477226 -0.06211969
[2,] 0.4688206  0.42193991  0.7302967  0.48844043
[3,] 0.5236384  0.02098714  0.1825742 -0.79052178
[4,] 0.5784562 -0.37996563 -0.3651484  0.36420104
```

========================================================
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

* Taking a product of `A` with one of its zero eigenvectors, we get


```r
A %*% eigen(A)$vectors[,3]
```

```
              [,1]
[1,] -8.881784e-16
[2,]  0.000000e+00
[3,]  8.881784e-16
[4,]  1.776357e-15
```

```r
A %*% eigen(A)$vectors[,4]
```

```
              [,1]
[1,] -8.881784e-16
[2,]  0.000000e+00
[3,]  8.881784e-16
[4,]  0.000000e+00
```

* Specifically, this gives a dependence relationship as,


```r
A[,1] *eigen(A)$vectors[1,3] + A[,2] *eigen(A)$vectors[2,3] + A[,3] *eigen(A)$vectors[3,3] + A[,4] *eigen(A)$vectors[4,3]
```

```
[1] -8.881784e-16  0.000000e+00  8.881784e-16  1.776357e-15
```


========================================================
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

* Recall now that the eigenvalues of `diag(1:3)` are 1, 2 and 3.

* <b>Q:</b> can you tell how these eigenvalues relate to the value


```r
det(diag(1:3))
```

```
[1] 6
```

* <b>A:</b> In fact, the determinant of the matrix is equal to the product of the eigenvalues.

* From the above, we recover a general equivalence:

<blockquote>
The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has an inverse $\Leftrightarrow$ $\mathrm{det}\left(\mathbf{A}\right) \neq 0$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $\mathbf{A}$ has no linear dependence between its columns $\Leftrightarrow$ the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has no zero eigenvalues $\Leftrightarrow$ the linear inverse problem $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution for $\mathbf{x}$. 
</blockquote>

* All of the above statements are equivalent and are useful to equivalently in different scenarios.

========================================================
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

*  This shows how the determinant is related to the eigenvalues and the spectrum of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.

* The trace is also related to the eigenvalues as follows:

  * Let the collection of all eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ be defined as $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^k$ for some $k\leq n$, then
  $$\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i$$
  
*  We will use this fact shortly when we discuss the Frobenius norm.

* At the moment, we will introduce a basic case of the spectral theorem, that is useful for understanding the idea of a matrix norm.

========================================================
### A special case of the spectral theorem

* Suppose that we have a matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ where we assume that $p \leq n$.

* We will define a square product of this matrix  with itself so that the dimensionality makes sense, and so that it is in the smallest dimension $p\times p$ as,
 
 $$\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{p\times p}.$$
 
* The spectral theorem guarantees that this matrix can be transformed into a diagonal matrix in an appropriate real-valued coordinate change, and the diagonal will have only non-negative values on the diagonal.

*  Particularly, the $p$ non-negative values on the diagonal are the eigenvalues $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^p$ of $\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{A}$ (or the singular values squared of $\mathbf{A}$).

* The reason that this can be decomposed into such a coordinate system is because of the symmetry of the product under transpose:

  $$\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{A}\right)^\mathrm{T} = \mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \left(\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\right)^\mathrm{T} =\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{A}$$

* The reason that the eigenvalues must be non-negative is because this acts like the square of a scalar, but in terms of the scalar eigenvalues.

========================================================
### The matrix norm

* There are many ways we can describe the "length" of the matrix, and all give different features more prominence, but are algebraicly equivalent up to rescaling.

* One particularly useful type of norm is known as the Frobenius norm of a matrix, and arises naturally due to the previous decomposition.

* We note that $\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{A}$ has p non-negative eigenvalues and that therefore,

  $$\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{A}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^p \lambda_i.$$
  can be computed directly by solving for the eigenvalues.
  
* Particularly, this gives a kind of weighted measure of the expansion and contraction under the map $\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{A}$.

* We define the Frobenius norm as an actual mathematical matrix "distance" as,

  $$\parallel \mathbf{A}\parallel_F = \sqrt{\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{A}\right)}$$

========================================================
### The Frobenius norm

* The Frobenius norm,

  $$\parallel \mathbf{A}\parallel_F = \sqrt{\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{A}\right)}$$
   
  is a particularly useful distance to understand as it relates to the singular value decomposition / principal component analysis.

  * This is also the choice of norm that arises from the inner product of matrices defined in terms of,
  
  $$\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{A}\right)$$
  for $\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$.
  
* This has a very similar interpretation then in terms of the Euclidean norm for a vector, but extended to matrices.

  
========================================================
### The matrix norm

* To compute a matrix norm in R, this is performed with the `norm` function.

* There are several different choices, but in terms of making some choice, you should understand what is special about that choice of norm.

* We can also use the default choice that R provides to produce a size of the matrix in terms of the maximum size of one of its columns, treated as
  
  $$\parallel \mathbf{A} \parallel_1 = \max_{j=1, \cdots, p} \sum_{i=1}^n \vert a_{i,j}\vert$$

========================================================
### The matrix norm


* For a generic matrix, we can see the differences in the length estimation as follows:


```r
A <- matrix(c(1,2), nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
A
```

```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    2
[2,]    1    2
```

```r
norm(A) # default norm
```

```
[1] 4
```

```r
norm(A, type="f") # frobenius norm
```

```
[1] 3.162278
```


========================================================
### The matrix norm

* Note the eigenvalue decomposition as,


```r
eigen(t(A) %*% A)
```

```
eigen() decomposition
$values
[1] 10  0

$vectors
          [,1]       [,2]
[1,] 0.4472136 -0.8944272
[2,] 0.8944272  0.4472136
```

* and therefore we find $\parallel \mathbf{A}\parallel_F = \sqrt{\mathrm{tr\left(\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{A}\right)}}= \sqrt{10 + 0} =$


```r
sqrt(10)
```

```
[1] 3.162278
```

```r
norm(A, type="f")
```

```
[1] 3.162278
```

========================================================
## A summary of main ideas

<ul>
  <li>The main ideas to take away from this  introduction to matrix algebra are the following:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Matrix multiplication is a general case of vector <b>multiplication of rows versus columns</b>.  This is fundamentally different from the element-wise multiplication which does not contain the same mathematical / geometric meaning of the inner product or matrix product.  Paricularly, 
      $$\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{b} = \parallel \mathbf{a} \parallel * \parallel \mathbf{b} \parallel \cos\left(\theta\right),
  \end{align}$$
  so that this product is a scalar value that depends on the lengths and angle between the vectors.
    </li>
    <li>The <b>general matrix product</b> is defined as,
  $$\begin{align}
  \mathbf{N} \mathbf{M}  = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
  \mathbf{n}_1^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{m_1} & \mathbf{n}_1^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{m}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{n}_1^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{m}_M \\
  \vdots & \ddots & \cdots & \vdots \\
  \mathbf{n}_N^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{m}_1 & \mathbf{n}_N^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{m}_2 & \cdots & \mathbf{n}_N^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{m}_M
  \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times M}
  \end{align}$$</li>
    <li>As an algebra system, <strong>matrices only have inverses under certain conditions</strong>:
    <blockquote>
The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has an inverse $\Leftrightarrow$ $\mathrm{det}\left(\mathbf{A}\right) \neq 0$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $\mathbf{A}$ has no linear dependence between its columns $\Leftrightarrow$ the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has no zero eigenvalues $\Leftrightarrow$ the linear inverse problem $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution for $\mathbf{x}$. 
</blockquote></li>
  <li><b>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe special coordinate systems</b> in which the effect of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ can be described as <strong>diagonal or close-to-diagonal, but such coordinate systems may be complex valued</strong>.</li>
  <li>These also provide a useful way to describe the length of the matrix in terms of the Frobenius norm, but multiple choices of norm exist with different interpretations of length.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
