========================================================
## Introduction to regression

* In the last part, we saw how we can form a basic regression model with a proposal of the relationship for how the variables $Y$ and $X$ vary together as

  $$\begin{align}
  Y = g(X) + \epsilon & & \epsilon \sim F_\epsilon.
  \end{align}$$
  
* Particularly, when we assume a linear form this is written as

  $$\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_{p-1} X_{p-1} + \epsilon.
  \end{align}$$
  
* We also saw some basic methods of hypothesis testing and evaluating the goodness of fit for this model.

* However, neither $R^2$ nor adjusted $R^2$ may be totally adequate for differentiating between different plausible choices for the relationship.

  * Likewise, hypothesis testing for a "best" choice may saturate the p-values with many hypothesis tests, in which we will very likely obtain false positives and false negatives for significance.

* When we have many possible variables to regress upon, other popular means of model selection include criterion methods, including the AIC, the BIC and Mallow's Cp.

========================================================

## Information criteria

* The Akaike informtation criterion (AIC) is given as

  $$\begin{align}
  AIC = n \log\left(\frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}^\mathrm{T}\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}}{n}\right) + 2p
  \end{align}$$
  
* Lower AIC scores are preferred, where this can be seen as an optimization of
  1. minimizing the average, sum of square residuals of the predicted versus the observed data; versus
  2. the number of parameters we choose to include in the model.

* There are many different possible criteria we can consider, of similar flavor to the above, for the model selection.

* The most well-known competitor is the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) given of the form,

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathrm{BIC} =2n \log\left(\frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}^\mathrm{T}\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}}{n}\right) + p \log(n),
  \end{align}$$
  
* The BIC is extremely similar, but it has a stronger penalty term and favors simpler models overall.

* From a numerical optimization perspective, both of the above can be considered penalized objective functions, where we penalize models for becoming too complex without added value in terms of goodness of fit.

========================================================
<h3> An example of criterion approaches versus backward selection</h3>

* We will study this in an example looking at life expectancy as regressed upon by demographic factors in various states of the USA, 


```r

<h3> An example of criterion approaches versus backward selection</h3>

* With a pre-selected value of $\alpha_\mathrm{crit}=5\%$, we will go through backward elimination -- i.e., we will eliminate predictors which are not significant.


```r
lmod <- lm(Life.Exp ~ ., statedata)
sumary(lmod)
```

```
               Estimate  Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)  7.0943e+01  1.7480e+00 40.5859 < 2.2e-16
Population   5.1800e-05  2.9187e-05  1.7748   0.08318
Income      -2.1804e-05  2.4443e-04 -0.0892   0.92934
Illiteracy   3.3820e-02  3.6628e-01  0.0923   0.92687
Murder      -3.0112e-01  4.6621e-02 -6.4590  8.68e-08

Frost       -5.7350e-03  3.1432e-03 -1.8246   0.07519
Area        -7.3832e-08  1.6682e-06 -0.0443   0.96491

n = 50, p = 8, Residual SE = 0.74478, R-Squared = 0.74
```

* As a remark, in the big model we see that the murder rate is strongly significant explanatory variable on life expectancy but, unusually, income (for this model) is not.

* This may be understood in part where other variables tigthly correlated with income (illiteracy, education) might make some information redundant.

* The p-values of one t-test depend on the other variables in the model in general; 

  * the presence of a highly correlated variable may make one variable lose significance in the presence of the other. 

========================================================
<h3> An example of criterion approaches versus backward selection</h3>

* On the last summary, Area had the largest p-value greater than $5\%$, so we eliminate this, using the "update" function.


```r
lmod <- update(lmod, . ~ . - Area)
sumary(lmod)
```

```
               Estimate  Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)

Murder      -3.0182e-01  4.3344e-02 -6.9634 1.454e-08

Frost       -5.7758e-03  2.9702e-03 -1.9446   0.05839

n = 50, p = 7, Residual SE = 0.73608, R-Squared = 0.74
```

========================================================
<h3> An example of criterion approaches versus backward selection</h3>

* Subsequently, illiteracy should be removed:


```r
lmod <- update(lmod, . ~ . - Illiteracy)
sumary(lmod)
```

```
               Estimate  Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)  7.1066e+01  1.0289e+00 69.0669 < 2.2e-16

Income      -2.4771e-05  2.3160e-04 -0.1070   0.91531
Murder      -3.0001e-01  3.7042e-02 -8.0992 2.907e-10
HS.Grad      4.7758e-02  1.8591e-02  2.5689   0.01367
Frost       -5.9099e-03  2.4678e-03 -2.3948   0.02095

n = 50, p = 6, Residual SE = 0.72773, R-Squared = 0.74
```

========================================================
<h3> An example of criterion approaches versus backward selection</h3>

* Next, we remove income,


```r
lmod <- update(lmod, . ~ . - Income)
sumary(lmod)
```

```
               Estimate  Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 71.02712853  0.95285296 74.5415 < 2.2e-16
Population   0.00005014  0.00002512  1.9960  0.052005
Murder      -0.30014880  0.03660946 -8.1987 1.775e-10
HS.Grad      0.04658225  0.01482706  3.1417  0.002968
Frost       -0.00594329  0.00242087 -2.4550  0.018018

n = 50, p = 5, Residual SE = 0.71969, R-Squared = 0.74
```


========================================================
<h3> An example of criterion approaches versus backward selection</h3>

* and finally we remove population:


```r
lmod <- update(lmod, . ~ . - Population)
sumary(lmod)
```

```
              Estimate Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 71.0363788  0.9832622 72.2456 < 2.2e-16
Murder      -0.2830652  0.0367313 -7.7064 8.039e-10
HS.Grad      0.0499487  0.0152011  3.2859  0.001950
Frost       -0.0069117  0.0024475 -2.8240  0.006988

n = 50, p = 4, Residual SE = 0.74267, R-Squared = 0.71
```

* we could possibly include population anyway (as it is really on the line), but the difference in $R^2$ is not large, so we may prefer the smaller model.

========================================================
<h3> An example of criterion approaches versus backward selection</h3>

* It therefore is important to remember that even when we have removed a variable, this doesn't mean that it has no impact on the response -- this is always understood relative to the overall model in questions.

* Respectively, if we fit,


```r
sumary(lm(Life.Exp ~ Illiteracy+Murder+Frost, statedata))
```

```
              Estimate Std. Error  t value  Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 74.5567171  0.5842507 127.6108 < 2.2e-16
Illiteracy  -0.6017607  0.2989270  -2.0131  0.049981
Murder      -0.2800474  0.0433940  -6.4536 6.033e-08
Frost       -0.0086910  0.0029595  -2.9367  0.005166

n = 50, p = 4, Residual SE = 0.79112, R-Squared = 0.67
```

we see that illiteracy is significant with respect to a different choice of variables.

* Particularly, we cannot reliably conclude that illiteracy is not a variable of interest, only that it is surprising that it would be more important than the other variables in the model chosen by backward selection.

  

========================================================

<h3> An example of criterion approaches versus backward selection</h3>

* We will use the BIC to reselect the life expectancy model by state, using the `leaps` library -- this will exhaustively search through the dataset for the best: 1 predictor model, 2 predictor model, 3 predictor model, and so forth...


```r
library("leaps")
sum_life <- summary(regsubsets(Life.Exp~.,data=statedata))

```


========================================================

<h3> An example of the BIC</h3>


* With three explanatory variables, we find the model that uses the murder rate, high school graduation and frost variables once again.

* The BIC for each "best model in p-parameters" can be called with


```r
sum_life$bic
```

```
[1] -39.22051 -42.62472 -46.70678 -47.03640 -43.13738 -39.23342 -35.32373
```

* Note, the scale of the above values are interpretable in terms of the difference of each BIC computed versus the minimum attainable over the data set.

* Therefore, we can rescale to have more meaning as


```r
sum_life$bic - min(sum_life$bic)
```

```
[1]  7.8158932  4.4116859  0.3296237  0.0000000  3.8990253  7.8029800 11.7126711
```

* Models that have relatively small difference $\mathcal{O}\left(10^{-1}\right)$ or $\mathcal{O}\left(10^{0}\right)$ are those that can be reasonably considered as alternatives to the empirical minimum computed above.

========================================================

<h3> Adjusted $R^2_a$</h3>


* We also see the $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2_a$ of each model by calling this as an argument of the summary of the output:


```r
sum_life$rsq
```

```
[1] 0.6097201 0.6628461 0.7126624 0.7360328 0.7361014 0.7361440 0.7361563
```

```r
sum_life$adjr2
```

```
[1] 0.6015893 0.6484991 0.6939230 0.7125690 0.7061129 0.6993268 0.6921823
```

* As with $R^2$, the $R^2_a$ represents better fit when it is larger.

* In each of these alternative measures, we see that the model with population included (4 predictors) is actually favored.


========================================================

<h3> Mallow's $C_p$</h3>

* As an alternative criterion, we can consider "how well does the model predict?" in the mean square sense.

* In the case that there isn't a lack of fit, then the Mallow's $C_p \approx p$, the number of parameters.

* Therefore, Mallow's $C_p$ favors the smallest model of $p_0$ parameters where the coefficient is $C_{p_0} \approx p_0$, approaching $p_0$ from above.

  * For any values of Mallow's $C_p$ which are smaller, but for which $C_p &lt; p$, we conclude that there is not a good fit to the data.
  
* We can extract Mallow's $C_p$ as a value from the regsubsets summary as,


```r
sum_life$cp
```

```
[1] 16.126760  9.669894  3.739878  2.019659  4.008737  6.001959  8.000000
```
 

========================================================

<h3> Mallow's $C_p$</h3>

* We plot Mallow's $C_p$ versus the number of <b>parameters</b> as 
  

```r
par(cex=3, mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(1,0,0))
plot(2:8,sum_life$cp,xlab="No. of Parameters",ylab="Cp Statistic")
abline(0,1)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13](lesson_21_12_01-figure/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

* Notice, Mallow's $C_p$ gives an indication that the model with 3 predictors (4 parameters) is a good choice;

  * the model with 4 predictors (5 parameters) has fallen too low, and is no longer a good fit in this sense.

========================================================

<h3> Practical computation for large models</h3>

* We note that combinatorially, if we have $q$ potential explanatory variables that we might try to choose whether or not to put into a model, there will be to choices per variable:
  <ol>
  <li>yes we include this;</li>
  <li>no we don't include this.</li>
  </ol>
* Each choice is independent from each other choice, so that the total number of combinations we can consider is $2^q$.

* Suppose there are 20 possible variables we might consider -- this corresponds to:


```r
as.integer(2)^20
```

```
[1] 1048576
```
 
 * That is, we will have over one million  models to compare... 
 
* Exhaustive search is strictly infeasible even for a (relatively) small number of possible explanatory variables.

  * In practice, this will depend on computational power limitations, but typically we must compromise.  
  
  * Try using exhaustive search based on your hardware, and if there is no reasonable time to convergence, quit it.

========================================================

### Step-wise information criteria

* An alternative is to use an incremental approach, mixing the ad-hoc method we considered at the beginning, with a specific criterion for the best choice of model.

* Particularly we can compute, e.g., the AIC for all one predictor models;

* then we can compute the AIC for all two predictor models with the first chosen variable imposed on the model with two predictors.

* This may not produce an optimal model in the same sense as exhaustive search, but is a cheaper alternative that avoids the problems with many multiple hypothesis tests.

* This is done explicitly in R with the "step" function.

* Likewise, this can be done by a method of reduction starting with a large model.
  
  * By default, the step function will use the backward method, though it can be performed by forward, backward or both-ways selection.
  
========================================================

### Step-wise information criteria

* The output process is too long to see completely on the slide, but the code is presented for reference.

* If we examine the step-wise AIC, we will find that the model above is favored. 

* Exhaustive search with AIC and BIC also favor this, but Mallow's Cp favors removing population (which is not significant).

### Examining model quality

* It is often the case when variables are strongly correlated, we may have multiple reasonable choices for the model selection and the judgment of what is better may be qualitative.

* However, we should generally compare all reasonable models together to determine if we would arrive at the same conclusions between them.

* Likewise, we should examine the model quality to see if our linear model assumptions seem to be valid.

* In order to do so, one must generally use a series of diagnostics to determine if,
  1. the linear model itself seems plausible based on the relationships between the predictors and the response;
  2. it appears that the assumption $\mathrm{cov}\left(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\right) = \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}$ is true;
  3. we can make formal hypothesis tests based on the assumption of normal error distributions (or by the central limit; theorem).
  4. unusual observations have contributed to a major change in the model fit and / or the interpretation. 
  
* Each of these topics can be given considerable attention, and it goes beyond our current scope to discuss this;

  * however, one typical means of doing so is pictured in the next slide.

========================================================
## Nonparametric regression

* The general idea of regression analysis is to find a reasonable relation between two variables $X$ and $Y$. 

* For n realizations $\{(x_i , y_i )\}_{i=1}^n$, the relation can be modeled by

  $$\begin{align}
  y_i = g(x_i) + \epsilon_i
  \end{align}$$
  for each $i=1,\cdots, n$ where $X$ is our explanatory variable, $Y$ is the explained variable, and $\epsilon$ is the noise.

* A parametric estimation would suggest $g(x_i) = g(x_i , \theta)$; 
  
  * therefore estimating $g$ results in estimating $\theta$ and using $\hat{g}(x_i) = g(x_i, \hat{\theta})$. 
  
* In contrast, nonparametric regression allows $g$ to have any shape, in the sense that $g$ need not belong to a set of defined functions. 

* Nonparametric regression provides a powerful tool by allowing wide flexibility for $g$. 

* It avoids a biased regression, and might be a good starting point for a parametric regression if no ‘a priori’ shape of $g$ is known. 

* It is also a reliable way to spot outliers within the regression.

========================================================
### Nonparametric regression

* In the above, the following general assumptions must hold:
  1. $\mathbb{E}\left[ \epsilon\right] = 0$ and $\mathrm{var}\left(\epsilon\right) = \sigma^2$
  2.  $g(x) \approx y_i$ , for $x \approx x_i$.
  3. If $x$ is ‘far’ from $x_j$, we want $(x_j , y_j )$ to not interact with $g(x)$ in the region of $x_i$.

* Therefore one has to build a function as a finite sum of $g_i(x)$, where $g_i(x)$ is related to the point $(x_i, y_i)$. 

* Without loss of generality,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \hat{g}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n g_i(x) & & g_i(x) \approx
  \begin{cases}
  y_i &\text{ when }x\approx x_i\\
  0 & \text{ else}
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}$$

* This can be written as a weighted sum or local average
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \hat{g}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i(x)y_i
  \end{align}$$
  with the weight $w_i(x)$ defined as a function of $x$, constructed from each $x_i$.

========================================================
### Nonparametric regression


* The form

  $$\begin{align}
  \hat{g}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i(x)y_i
  \end{align}$$
  is quite appealing, because it is similar to the solution of the least squares minimization problem.
  
* That is, it can be written as

  $$\begin{align}
  \min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}}\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(x) \left(\theta - y_i\right)^2
  \end{align}$$
  which is solved for $\theta$.
  
* The benefit of this approach is thus that finding a local average is the same as finding a locally weighted least squares estimate, with some appropriate choice of weights.

* One method similar to the histogram divides the set of observations into bins of size $h$ and computes the mean within each bin by,

  $$\begin{align}
  \hat{g}(x) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n I\left\{\vert x - x_i\vert\ < h/2 \right\} \times y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n I\left\{\vert x - x_i\vert\ < h/2 \right\}}
  \end{align}$$

* In the above, $I$ measures whether $x$ lies in the range $h/2$ from $x_i$ and gives a $1$ if yes and a $0$ if no;
  
  * $\hat{g}(x)$ then gives a local average of the values of $y_i$ within an appropriate range of $x$.


========================================================
### Nonparametric regression

* The previous method is implemented in R via the function `ksmooth()` choosing the parameter `kernel =’box’`.

* As with the density estimation, we can bring into play the kernel functions for the weights, giving more flexibility and smoother averages.

* We then have the general estimator $\hat{g}(x)$ related to the bandwidth $h$ and to a kernel $K$ given as,

$$\begin{align}
  \hat{g}(x) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{ x - x_i}{h}\right) \times y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{ x - x_i}{h}\right)}
  \end{align}$$

* The weights are then given as,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  w_i = \frac{K\left(\frac{ x - x_i}{h}\right)}{\sum_{i=1}^n K\left(\frac{ x - x_i}{h}\right)}
  \end{align}$$
  
* The above type of estimator does come with flaws, as the choice of the bandwith $h$ is non-unique and may require separately some amount of optimization.

* For example, we regress the daily log-returns of the DAX stock index on the daily log-returns of the FTSE stock index with different choices of $h$ in the next slide.

### Nonparametric regression

* In addition to the need to tune hyper-parameters, we lose some of the interpretability that we can obtain with more structure by the linear regression / parametric model assumptions.

* In general, there are many tradeoffs in selecting a type of regression method, and it is most important to understand the strengths and limitations of different approaches.

  * This is especially important in how we reason with these methods, and if we can trust with any certainty the predictions and conclusions derived from the model.

* This is just meant to give a quick survey of some of the approaches one might take;

  * further information and references to follow more details about analysis and implementation is included in the recommended textbook.
