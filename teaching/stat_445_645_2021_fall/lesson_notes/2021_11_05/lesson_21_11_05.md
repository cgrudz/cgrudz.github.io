<h2>Outline</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The following topics will be covered in this lecture:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Linear programming problems</li>
    <li>Nonlinear programming problems</li>
  </ul>
</ul>


========================================================
## Motivation

* In our previous discussion of optimization, we <strong>focused on optimization without constraints</strong>.

  * This arises commonly in statistical estimation problems and is actually a <b>simpler case of the constrained optimization problem</b>.
  
* Constrained optimization also commonly arises in statistical  estimation.
  
   * For instance, suppose that we need to <b>estimate the variance</b> of some distribution by an optimization routine.
   
   * A fully unconstrained optimization could (in principle) lead to nonsensical values for the variance.
   
   * The <strong>variance is defined to be strictly non-negative</strong>, where a solution giving $\sigma^2<0$ would cause obvious errors in our analysis.

* In this final discussion of optimization, we will consider how constraints are introduced to our optimization framework.

* This will lead us into two classes of constrained optimization problems:
  
  * <b style="color:#d95f02">Linear Programming (LP) problems</b>; and 
  * <b style="color:#1b9e77">Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problems</b>.
  
* After introducing some general concepts, we will consider several techniques that can be used in the R language to handle such problems.


========================================================
## Linear Programming problems

<div style="float:left; width:70%">
<ul>
   <li> A <b style="color:#d95f02">LP optimization</b> is a method to find the solution to an optimization problem with:</li>
   <ol>
     <li> a <strong>linear objective function</strong>, and </li>
     <li>constraints in the form of <strong>linear equalities and linear inequalities</strong>.</li>
   </ol>
   <li> When we say a <b style="color:#d95f02">linear objective function</b>, we are referring to a linear $f$ such that
   $$\begin{align}
   f:\mathbb{R}^{n} &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
    \pmb{x}&\rightarrow  \pmb{a}^\top \pmb{x}
   \end{align}$$
  as this must be represented by a <strong>linear map (matrix multiplication)</strong> that transfers $\pmb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ to a real value.</li>
  <li>This is thus given precisely by a vector product as above for some $\pmb{a}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ as we can treat this product as
  $$\begin{align}
  \underbrace{\pmb{a}^\top}_{1\times n} \underbrace{\pmb{x}}_{n \times 1} = \underbrace{y}_{1\times 1}\in \mathbb{R}
  \end{align}$$</li>
  <li>Respectively, when we say that we have linear constraints, these can describe, e.g.,
  $$\begin{align}
  x_1 + x_2 \leq 1 & & x_1 - x_2 \leq 1 & & -x_1 + x_2 \leq 1 & & -x_1 - x_2 \leq 1.
  \end{align}$$</li>
  <li>Generally, therefore, a LP optimization has a <b>region of acceptable solutions</b> defined by a <strong>convex polyhedron</strong>, which is a set made by the intersection of finitely many half-spaces.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
   <li>This <strong>convex polyhedron</strong> is denoted $\Omega$ and called the <b>feasible region of the problem</b>.</li>
   <li>The objective of linear programming is to <strong>find a point in the feasible region</strong> where the objective function reaches a minimum or maximum value.</li>
</ul>
</div>



========================================================
### Linear Programming problems


* A representative LP problem can be expressed as finding $\pmb{x}^\ast$ such that

  $$\begin{align}
   f(\pmb{x}^\ast) &= \max_{\pmb{x}\in \Omega} \pmb{a}^\top \pmb{x},\quad \text{subject to:}\\ \\
   &\mathbf{C}\pmb{x} \leq \pmb{b},\\
   &\pmb{x} \geq \pmb{0},
   \end{align}$$
   where $\pmb{b}$ is a <strong>vector of known coefficients</strong> and $\mathbf{C}$ is a <strong>known matrix of the coefficients in the constraints</strong>.

* Because the objective function is linear, it is <b>both convex and concave</b> simultaneously.

* Therefore, as long as the constraints are consistent, 
  
  * and provide a bounded feasible region as seen before,
 
* we can obtain a <strong>global minimum or maximum</strong> for such a problem <b>on the feasible region boundary</b>.

* Although the linear objective function is a strong constraint on the problem

 * this type of problem can represent a variety of practical optimization scenarios...


========================================================
### Linear Programming problems


* For example, suppose that a farmer has a piece of farm land, say $L$ $\mathrm{km}^2$, to be planted with either wheat or barley or some combination of the two. 

* The farmer has a limited amount of fertilizer, $F$ kg, and pesticide, $P$ kg. 

* Every square kilometer of wheat requires $F_1$ kilograms of fertilizer and $P_1$ kilograms of pesticide.

* On the other hand, every square kilometer of barley requires $F_2$ kilograms of fertilizer and $P_2$ kilograms of pesticide. 

* Let $S_1$ be the selling price of wheat per square kilometer, and $S_2$ be the selling price of barley. 

* If we denote the area of land planted with wheat and barley by $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, then <b>profit can be maximized by choosing optimal values</b> for $x_1$ and $x_2$. 


========================================================
### Linear Programming problems

* The example problem can be expressed with the following linear programming problem in the standard form:

   $$\begin{align}
   \text{Maximize: } S_{1}\cdot x_{1}+S_{2}\cdot x_{2}  & &\text{(maximize the revenue)}\\
      \text{Subject to:}\\
      x_{1}+x_{2}\leq L & & \text{(limit on total area)}\\
      F_{1}\cdot x_{1}+F_{2}\cdot x_{2}\leq F & & \text{(limit on fertilizer)}\\
      P_{1}\cdot x_{1}+P_{2}\cdot x_{2}\leq P & &	\text{(limit on pesticide)}\\
      x_{1}\geq 0,x_{2}\geq 0 & & \text{(cannot plant a negative area).}
    \end{align}$$
    
* Alternatively, in matrix form we have this written equivalently as

  $$\begin{align}
  \text{Maximize: }\pmb{S}^\top \pmb{x} \\
  \text{Subject to:}\\
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 1\\ F_1 & F_2 \\ P_1 & P_2
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x_1 \\ x_2 
  \end{pmatrix}
  \leq \begin{pmatrix}L \\ F \\ P \end{pmatrix} \\
  \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} \geq \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
  \end{align}$$


========================================================
### Linear Programming problems

* Linear programming problems as above can be solved in R by using the R wrapper for the  <b>GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK)</b>.

* This comes in the package `Rglpk` below:


```r
require(Rglpk)
```

* As an example, we will show how to solve the following problem,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \text{Maximize: }\begin{pmatrix}2 \\ 4\end{pmatrix}^\top \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix}\\
  \text{Subject to:} & &
  \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4\end{pmatrix}^\top \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix} \leq 60 & & 
  \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{pmatrix} \geq \pmb{0}
  \end{align}$$

* We will use the `Rglpk_solve_LP` with the following arguments:

  * `obj` - a numeric vector representing the <strong>objective coefficients</strong>.
  * `mat` - a matrix of <strong>constraint coefficients</strong>.
  * `dir` - a character vector with the <strong>directions of the constraints</strong>, `"<"`, `"<="`, `">"`, `">="`, or `"=="`.
  * `rhs` - a numeric vector representing the <strong>right hand side of the constraints</strong>.

========================================================

```r
Rglpk_solve_LP(obj = c(2, 4), 
               mat = matrix(c(3, 4), nrow = 1),
               dir ="<=",
               rhs = 60,
               max = TRUE)

========================================================
## Nonlinear Programming problems

* The NLP has an analogous definition as that of the LP problem. 

* The differences between NLP and LP are that the <b style="color:#1b9e77">objective function or the constraints in an NLP can be nonlinear functions</b>. 

* NLP has some similarity then to what we saw in our discussion of unconstrained optimization, thus, in that we will often be <strong>concerned with finding a local minima or local maxima</strong>.
  
* Techniques such as <b>Newton's descent and gradient descent</b> can be <strong>revised to handle the constraints defining the feasible region</strong>.

* These methods tend to become, however, much more complex to develop, and we will only introduce a simple example here.

* Particularly, we will consider the nonlinear objective function with the linear constraints below:
  
  $$\begin{align}
  f(\pmb{x}^\ast) =& \max_{x_1 , x_2}  \sqrt{5x_1} + \sqrt{3x_2} ,\\
  & \text{subject to:} \quad 3x_1 + 5x_2 \leq 10,\\
  & x_1 \geq 0,\\
  & x_2 \geq 0.
  \end{align}$$
  
* This type of linearly constrained, nonlinear objective function can be optimized with the `constOptim` function of the `stats` package in R.

```r
require(stats)
```

========================================================
### Nonlinear Programming problems

* The `constOptim` function is an extension of the `optim` function in R that allows for a feasible region.

* This function is given with syntax

```
constrOptim(theta, f, grad, ui, ci)
```

* where
  * `theta`	-- is the <strong>numerical starting value</strong> in the feasible region.
  * `f` -- is the	<strong>function to minimize</strong>.
  * `grad` --  is the <strong>gradient</strong> of `f` as a function or `NULL`.
  * `ui`	-- is the <strong>constraint matrix</strong> (k x p).
  * `ci`	-- is the <strong>constraint vector</strong> of length k.

* We'll start by defining the function and the constraints:


```r
f <- function(x){
 -sqrt(5 * x[1]) - sqrt(3 * x[2])
 }
A <- matrix(c(-3, -5), nrow = 1, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
b <- c(-10)
```


========================================================
### Nonlinear Programming problems

* Running the optimization:


```r
constrOptim(f = f, theta = c(1, 1), grad = NULL, ui = A, ci = b)
```

```

$convergence

$barrier.value

```

* Because we phrased this as the minimization of the negative function, the max value is $4.760952$ of the original.
