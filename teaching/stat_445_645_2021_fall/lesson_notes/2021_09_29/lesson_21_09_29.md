========================================================
## Motivation 


* Suppose we take a sample of $n = 10$ observations $\{x_{1,i}\}_{i=1}^{10}$ from a population and compute the sample average,
  
  $$\overline{x}_1 =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_{1,i} = \frac{1}{10}\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_{1,i}$$

  getting the result $\overline{x}_1 = 10.2$. 
  
* Now we repeat this process, taking a second sample of $n = 10$ observations from the same population, 

  $$\{x_{2,i}\}_{i=1}^{10}$$ 
  
  and the resulting sample average is $\overline{x}_2=10.4$.
  
* This discrepancy is what we call <b>sampling error</b>, in which the <strong>random variation in a sample</strong> of a fixed size $n$ upon replication produces <strong>differences in the computation of a statistic</strong>.

* The sample average depends on the observations in the sample, which differ from sample to sample because they are random variables. 

* Consequently, the <b>sample average</b> (or any other function of the sample data) is a <strong>random variable</strong>.

* Because a <b>statistic is a random variable</b>, it has a <strong>probability distribution</strong>.


========================================================
## Random samples


* Specifically, suppose that we want to obtain an estimate of a <b style="color:#1b9e77">population parameter</b>, where the population is modeled with a random variable $X$. 

* We know that before the data are collected, the observations are considered to be random variables, 

  * i.e., we treat an <b>independent sequence of measurements</b> of $X$,

  $$X_1, X_2, \cdots , X_n$$ 
  
  * as random variables all drawn from a <b style="color:#1b9e77">parent distribution</b> $X \sim F_X(x)$ (where the CDF will define the distribution).

  <blockquote>
  <b>Random sample</b><br>
  The random variables $X_1 , X_2, \cdots , X_n$ are a <strong>random sample</strong> of size $n$ if the $X_i$’s are independent random variables and every $X_i$ has the same probability distribution.
  </blockquote>
  
* We then say that the <b style="color:#d95f02">measurements</b> we obtain are <strong>possible outcomes</strong> of the sample variables $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$; particularly, if we make a computation of the sample mean,

  $$\overline{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$
  
  the above is treated as a random variable (a linear combination of random variables) which has a random outcome, dependent on the realizations of the $X_i$.


========================================================
### Random samples

* More generally, any function of the observations, i.e., <b style="color:#d95f02">any statistic</b>, is also modeled as a <strong>random variable</strong>.

* If $h$ is a <b>general function</b> used to <b style="color:#d95f02">compute some statistic</b>, we thus define

  $$\tilde{X} = h(X_1, \cdots, X_n)$$
  
  to be a <strong>random variable</strong> that will depend on the particular realizations of $X_1,\cdots, X_n$.


* We call the <b style="color:#d95f02">probability distribution of a statistic</b> a <b>sampling distribution</b>.

  <blockquote>
  <b>Sampling Distribution</b><br>
  The probability distribution of a statistic is called a <strong>sampling distribution</strong>.
  </blockquote>


========================================================
### Random samples

* Given <b>particular realizations</b> of the sample random variables, we obtain a <strong>fixed numerical value</strong>.

* Each numerical value in a data set is treated as the observed realization of a random variable. 

* Given particular realizations $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ of the random variables $X_1, \cdots, X_n$, the value

  $$\overline{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$
  
  is <strong>not a random variable</strong>, as this is a <b>fixed numerical value</b>.
  

* Given some particular, observed realizations $x_1, \cdots,x_n$, 

  $$\tilde{x} = h(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$$
  
  is a fixed numerical value, based on the fixed, observed data values $x_1, \cdots, x_n$.


========================================================
### Random samples


* When discussing inference problems, it is convenient to have a <b style="color:#1b9e77">general symbol to represent the parameter</b> of interest -- we use the Greek symbol $\theta$ (theta) to represent the parameter. 

* The symbol $\theta$ can represent the mean $\mu$, the variance $\sigma^2$, or any parameter of interest to us. 

* The objective of <b>point estimation</b> is to  <b style="color:#d95f02">estimate a single number based on sample data</b> that is the most plausible
value for $\theta$. 

* The numerical value of a sample statistic is used as the point estimate.

* Once we describe the process of point estimation, the next step is to describe how we <strong>quantify the uncertainty of the estimate</strong>.

* If $X$ is a random variable with probability distribution $F_X(x)$, characterized by the
unknown parameter $\theta$, 

 * and if $X_1 , X_2, \cdots , X_n$ is a random sample of size $n$ from $X$, 
  
* the statistic  $\hat{\Theta} = h(X_1 , X_2 , ... , X_n )$ given as a function of the sample is called a <b>point estimator of $\theta$</b>. 

* Note that $\hat{\Theta}$ is a <strong>random variable</strong> because it is a function of random variables. 

* After the sample has been selected, $\hat{\Theta}$ takes on a particular
numerical value $\hat{\Theta}$ called the point estimate of $\theta$.

* The <b>uncertainty of the point estimate $\hat{\Theta}$</b> can be understood as <strong>how much will the sampling error cause a discrepancy</strong> between $\hat{\Theta}$ and the true $\theta$.

========================================================
## Point estimators

<ul>
  <li>We will now introduce some formal definitions:</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none"><blockquote>
  <b>Point estimators</b><br>
  A <strong>point estimate</strong> of some population parameter $\theta$ is a single numerical value $\hat{\theta}$ of a statistic $\hat{\Theta}$.  This is a particular realization of the random variable $\hat{\Theta}$, viewed as a random variable; $\hat{\Theta}$ is called the <strong>point estimator</strong>. 
  </blockquote></li>
</ul>

* Estimation problems modeled as above occur frequently in engineering. 

* We often need to estimate
  * The mean $\mu$ of a single population
  * The variance $\sigma^2$ (or standard deviation $\sigma$) of a single population
  * The proportion $p$ of items in a population that belong to a class of interest
  * The difference in means of two populations, $\mu_1 - \mu_2$
  * The difference in two population proportions, $p_1 − p_2$


========================================================
### Point estimators

* Reasonable point estimates of these parameters are as follows:
  * For $\mu$, 
     * the estimate is $\hat{\mu}=\overline{x}$, the <b>sample mean</b>.
  * For $\sigma^2$, 
     * the estimate is $\hat{\sigma}^2 = s^2$, the <b>sample variance</b>.
  * For $p$, 
     * the estimate is $\hat{p}=\frac{x}{n}$, the <b>sample proportion</b>, where $x$ is the number of items in a random sample of size $n$ that belong to the class of interest.
  * For $\mu_1 -\mu_2$, 
     * the estimate $\hat{\mu}_1 - \hat{\mu}_2 = \overline{x}_1 - \overline{x}_2$, the <b>difference between the sample means</b> of two independent random samples.
  * For $p_1 − p_2$ , 
     * the estimate is $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ , the <b>difference between two sample proportions</b> computed
from two independent random samples.


* Although a point estimate may be the "best" estimate for a population parameter given a single sample, it is critically important to understand how far this estimate might be from the true value.

* In order to determine the accuracy of this estimate, we use the concept of the <b>sampling distribution</b> to <strong>derive hypothesis tests and confidence intervals</strong>.

========================================================
## Central limit theorem

* Let's consider a simple argument for the sampling distribution of the sample mean $X$. 

* Suppose that a random sample of size $n$ is taken from a <b>normal population</b> with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. 

* By definition of a <b>random sample</b> each observation in this sample, say, $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, is a <strong>normally and independently distributed random variable</strong> with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. 

* A special property of the normal distribution is that it can be translated and rescaled while remaining normal; 
  
  * similarly, a sum of independent, normally distributed random variables are also normally distributed.  
  
* We conclude that the sample mean

  $$\overline{X}= \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots  + X_n}{n}$$

  has a normal distribution with mean
  
  $$\mu_\overline{X} = \frac{\mu + \mu + \cdots + \mu}{n} = \mu$$

  * and variance
  
  $$\sigma^2_\overline{X} = \frac{\sigma^2 + \sigma^2 + \cdots + \sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$
  

========================================================
### Central limit theorem continued

* More generally, if we are sampling from a population that has an unknown probability distribution, the <strong>sampling distribution of the sample mean</strong> will still be <b>approximately normal</b> with mean $\mu$ and variance
$\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ if the sample size $n$ is large. 

* This is one of the most useful theorems in statistics, called the <b>central limit theorem</b>:

  <blockquote>
  <b>The central limit theorem</b><br>
  Let $X_1 , X_2 , \cdots , X_n$ be a random sample of size $n$ taken from a population with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$ and $\overline{X}$ be the sample mean.  Then the <strong>limiting form of the distribution</strong> of
  $$Z = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$
  as $n \rightarrow \infty$ is the <strong>standard normal distribution</strong>.
  </blockquote>
  
* Put another way, for $n$ sufficiently large, $\overline{X}$ has <b>approximately</b> a $N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)$ distribution -- this says the following.
  * Suppose we take a sample of size $n$ and compute the sample mean $\overline{X}$.
  * Then suppose we replicate this sample and record the observed realizations for the sample mean $\overline{x}_1, \overline{x}_2, \cdots$.
  * If the sample size $n$ is lage, these data points $\overline{x}_1, \cdots$ will be approximately bell shaped with the following properties:
     * the bell will be centered approximately at $\mu$, the true population mean;
     * the spread of the data around the center will be given by approximately by the standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
  * Particularly, if $n$ is very large, the observed sample means will be very close to the center (the true mean).

========================================================
### Central limit theorem continued

* The <b>central limit theorem</b> is the underlying reason why many of the random variables encountered in engineering and science are <strong>normally distributed</strong>. 

* The observed variable results from a <b>series of underlying disturbances</b> that act together to <strong>create a central limit effect</strong>.

  * This can be thought in terms of the sum of random disturbances averaged over a time interval will have an average effect like a normal variable.

* It is important, however, to consider when the sample size large enough so that the central limit theorem can be assumed to apply. 

* The answer depends on <strong>how close the underlying distribution is to the normal</strong>: 
  * if the <b>underlying distribution is normal</b>, <strong>any sample size will work</strong>;
  * if the underlying distribution is <b>symmetric and unimodal</b> (not too far from normal), the central limit
theorem will apply for <strong>sample sizes as low as 4 or 5</strong>. 
  * if the sampled population is <b>very nonnormal</b>, if the <strong>sample size is greater than 30</strong>, the central limit theorem will usually apply; however, there are exceptions to this guideline.

========================================================
### Standard error of an estimator

* As noted before, the <b>variance</b> is a "natural" measure of spread mathematically for theoretical reasons, but it is in the <strong>units squared of the original units</strong>.

* For this reason, when we talk about the spread of an estimator's sampling distribution, we typically discuss the <b>standard error</b>.

  <blockquote>
  <b>The standard error</b>
  Let $\hat{\Theta}$ be an estimator of $\theta$. The <strong>standard error error</strong> of $\hat{\Theta}$ is its <b>standard deviation</b> given by
  $$\sigma_\hat{\Theta} =  \sqrt{\mathrm{var}\left(\hat{\Theta}\right)}.$$
  If the standard error involves <b>unknown parameters that can be estimated</b>, substitution of those values into the equation above produces an estimated standard error denoted $\hat{\sigma}_\hat{\Theta}$.  It is also common to write the standard error as $\mathrm{SE}\left(\hat{\Theta}\right)$.
  </blockquote>
  
* <b>Q:</b> can you recall what the standard error is of the sample mean?  That is, what is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (for a normal sample or $n$ large)?

  * <b>A:</b> the central limit theorem states that $\overline{X}$ follows (exactly for a normal sample or $n$ large, approximately) a sampling distribution
  
  $$\overline{X}\sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right).$$
  
  * Therefore, the standard error of the sample mean is precisely,
  
  $$\sigma_{\overline{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.$$

========================================================
### Standard error of an estimator

* There are times that we may not know all the parameters that describe the standard error.

* For example, suppose we draw $X_1, \cdots, X_n$ from a <b>normal population</b>, for which <strong>we know neither the mean nor the variance</strong>.

* Let the unknown and unobservable theoretical parameters be denoted $\mu$ and $\sigma$ as usual.

* The sample mean has the sampling distribution,
 
  $$\overline{X} \sim N\left( \mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right),$$
  
  and therefore standard error $\sigma_{\overline{X}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
  
* However, we stated that $\sigma$ itself is <b>unknown</b>.

* In this case, we will <strong>estimate the standard error</strong> as

  $$\hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} =  \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
  with the <b>sample standard deviation</b> $s$.
  
* This is what is meant to estimate the standard error.
