========================================================
## Gaussian quadrature

* We can see in the last example, we will need to take many points in a partition to get an accurate approximation with the trapezoidal rule.

* One of the ways to overcome this is to use a more accurate kind of approximation, Gaussian-Quadrature.

* In R, the function `integrate()` uses an integration method that is based on Gaussian quadrature (the exact method is called the Gauss–Kronrod quadrature). 

* The Gaussian method uses non-predetermined nodes $x_1 , \cdots , x_n$ to approximate the integral, so that polynomials of higher order can be integrated more precisely than with using the Newton–Cotes rule. 

* For $n$ nodes, it uses a polynomial 
  
  $$p(x) =\sum_{j=1}^{2n} c_j x^{j-1}$$
  
  of order $2n-1$ in its highest power.
  
* We will not go into detail the differences between the Newton-Cotes scheme versus the Gaussian quadrature, but instead we will consider the difference with the last approximation.

========================================================
### Gaussian quadrature

* The `integrate` function works differently in which we need to supply a function, a lower and upper bound, and optionally the max-size of the partition -- finally we extract the value of the integral as a `$` variable from the resulting object.


```r
for (i in 2:2:20) {
  print(abs(2 - integrate(f=cos, lower=(-pi/2), upper=(pi/2), subdivisions=i)$value))
}
```

```
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
[1] 0
```

* Notice that this is vastly more accurate than the trapezoidal rule.

========================================================
### Gaussian quadrature

* We can get an estimate of the approximation error from the `integrate` output as well the number of sub-divisions used


```r
int_cos <- integrate(f=cos, lower=(-pi/2), upper=(pi/2), subdivisions=2)
int_cos$abs.error
```

```
[1] 2.220446e-14
```

```r
int_cos$subdivisions
```

```
[1] 1
```

```r
int_cos <- integrate(f=cos, lower=(-pi/2), upper=(pi/2), subdivisions=20)
int_cos$abs.error
```

```
[1] 2.220446e-14
```

```r
int_cos$subdivisions
```

```
[1] 1
```

* Note, Gaussian quadrature only needed to use a single sub-division in all the previous cases to obtain error at the order of $10^{-14}$.

* We will explore more of this in activities, reflecting on the relationship again between the density function and the CDF.


========================================================
## Integration in multiple variables

* Similar to numerical integration in one variable, an integration in multiple variables can be expressed as follows:

  $$\begin{align}
  \int_{a_1}^{b_1} \cdots \int_{a_p}^{b_p} f\left(x_1, \cdots, x_p\right)\mathrm{d}x_1 \cdots \mathrm{d}x_p \approx \sum_{i_1=1}^n \cdots \sum_{i_p=1}^n W_{i_1} \cdots W_{i_p} f\left(x_{i_1},\cdots, x_{i_p}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  where

  * $f$ is a function from $\mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$;
  * We integrate over the domain $[a_1, b_1]\times \cdots \times [a_p, b_p]$
  * $\left\{x_{i_j} \right\}_{i_j=1}^{n}$ are the partition points for the interval $[a_j, b_j]$; and
  * $W_{i_j}$ is a weight that is given to the associated sub-partition of the region.
  
* The issue with the direct approach as above is that the complexity will grow like $p^n$, i.e., the dimension to the power of the partition size.



========================================================
### Adaptive methods

* One better approach computationally is to make an <b>adaptive procedure</b>, where <strong>a refinement of the region is chosen based on the tolerated error in the final result</strong>.


* The adaptive method in the context of multiple integrals divides the integration region $D\in\mathbb{R}^p$ into subregions $S_j \in \mathbb{R}^p$. 

* For each subregion $S_j$, specific rules are applied to approximate the integral. 

* Define the error for each sub-region to be denoted by $E_j$. 

  * If the overall error $\sum_{j=1}^n E_j$ is smaller than a predefined tolerance level, the algorithm stops. 

* However, <b>if this condition is not met</b>, the <strong>highest error $\mathrm{max}_{j}\left(E_j\right)$ is selected and the corresponding region is split into additional subregions</strong>.

* To integrate functions of multiple variables in R, the package `cubature` can be used, with the method `cuhre` applying the adaptive scheme.

* We will consider an example in the following.

========================================================

<ul>
  <li>Plotted on the left is the function,
  $$\begin{align}

  analytically;</li>
  <li>we will use the adaptive approximation in R to see how well we can approximate this.</li>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================
### Adaptive methods

* Firstly we define the function and load the required package


```r
require(cubature)
integrand = function(args) {
  x <- args[1]
  y <- args[2]
  return (x^2 * y^3)
}
```


========================================================
### Adaptive methods

* Now we will apply our adaptive integration,


```r
adaptive_result <- cuhre(integrand, lowerLimit=c(0,0), upperLimit=c(1,1))
adaptive_result
```

```
$integral
[1] 0.08333333

$error
[1] 2.429561e-15

$nregions
[1] 2

$neval
[1] 195

$prob
[1] 0.00623341

$returnCode
[1] 0
```

========================================================
### Adaptive methods

* In the previous output, the prob was for the null and alternative hypothesis as follows:

  $$\begin{align}
  H_0: \text{ The given error estimate is not accurate} & & H_1: \text{ The given error estimate is accurate}
  \end{align}$$

* The prob value was $\approx 0.006$ so that we reject the null hypothesis;

  * the estimated error is given as,
  

```r
adaptive_result$error
```

```
[1] 2.429561e-15
```

  * the true error is given as,


```r
abs(1/12 - adaptive_result$integral)
```

```
[1] 4.163336e-17
```


* We see empirically, and corroborated by the hypothesis test, that the scheme is very accurate.


========================================================
### Monte Carlo methods

* As an alternative to an adaptive scheme, one can also use a random or Monte Carlo scheme to compute the integral.

* In the first step, $n$ points of dimension $p$ are randomly drawn from the region $[a_1,b_1]\times \cdots [a_p,b_p]$, such that

  $$\left(x_{1_1},\cdots, x_{p_1}\right),\cdots,  \left(x_{1_n},\cdots,x_{p_n}\right)$$
  are uniformly distributed over the region.
  
* In the second step, the p-dimensional volume is estimated by
  
  $$V = \prod_{i=1}^p (b_i - a_i)$$
  
  and the integrand $f$ is evaluated for all $n$ points. 
  
* In the third step, the <b>integral can be estimated using a weighted sample mean of the various outputs</b>:
  
  $$\mathcal{I}(f) \approx \hat{\mathcal{I}}(f) = \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n f\left(x_{1_i}, \cdots,x_{p_i}\right)$$

* That is, <strong>we approximate the integral as an equal weighted average of the sample values, where the weights are given by the volume divided by the sample size</strong>.

  * Note that we could also define the weights to be non-equal, and this approach can lead to more accurate Monte Carlo methods.


========================================================
### Monte Carlo methods

* We apply the Monte Carlo integration scheme now to the same problem as before using the `vegas()` function:


```r
set.seed(0)
mc_result <- vegas(integrand, lowerLimit=c(0,0), upperLimit=c(1,1))
mc_result
```

```
$integral
[1] 0.083392

$error
[1] 4.661786e-05

$neval
[1] 1007500

$prob
[1] 0.1626209

$returnCode
[1] 1
```

```r
abs(1/12 - mc_result$value)
```

```
numeric(0)
```

* In this case, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the error bound is inaccurate, and indeed we find that the actual result is extremely accurate.

========================================================
## A summary of main ideas

<ul>
  <li>The main ideas to take away from this introduction to numerical integration are the following:</li>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Numerical integration</b> follows the <strong>same basic logic that we see with Riemann sums</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>we will try to approximate the area under the curve (or the volume under the surface in multiple variables) using some representative point and an approximate area (or volume).</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b style="color:#d95f02">Riemann sums are a lot like histograms</b> in the sense that they converge slowly to the true value of the integral or density curve respectively;</li>
    <ul>
      <li>however,  <b style="color:#1b9e77">kernel density estimators (and quadrature) increase the flexibility and the rate of convergence</b> to the density function (or the area under the density function respectively).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>These <b>approximations improve when we take finer partitions</b> or, in the Monte Carlo approach, a larger sample size.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This is also similar to histograms / kernel density estimators which get better approximations of the density curve when the sample size is larger.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For the <b>density curve $f(x)$</b> and its respective <b>cumulative probability density function $F(x)$</b>, we know we generally have the following relationship:
    $$F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(s) \mathrm{d}s.$$</li>
    <li>Likewise, we generally have the following relationship,
    $$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^b f(s)\mathrm{d}s$$
  </ol>
  <li>We will thus consider some new ways to compute and estimate probability generally using these relationships in the activities.</li>
</ul>
