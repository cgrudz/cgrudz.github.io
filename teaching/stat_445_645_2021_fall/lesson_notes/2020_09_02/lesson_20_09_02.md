<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:

  * More on subsetting data
  * Skipping and removing elements
  * Vectorization
  

========================================================
## More on subsetting data

*  R has many powerful subset operators -- mastering them will allow you to easily perform complex operations on any kind of dataset.

* There are six different ways we can subset any kind of object, and three different subsetting operators for the different data structures.

* Let's start with the workhorse of R: a simple numeric vector.


```r
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
x
```

```
  a   b   c   d   e 
5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5 
```

* In R, simple vectors containing character strings, numbers, or logical values are called *atomic* vectors because they can't be further simplified.


========================================================
## Accessing elements using their indices

* So now that we've created a dummy vector to play with, how do we get at its contents?


* To extract elements of a vector we can give their corresponding index, starting from one:

```r
x[1]
```

```
  a 
5.4 
```


```r
x[4]
```

```
  d 
4.8 
```

* It may look different, but the square brackets operator is a function. 

* For vectors (and matrices), it means "get me the nth element".

========================================================
### Accessing elements using their indices -- continued

* We can ask for multiple elements at once:

```r
x[c(1, 3)]
```

```
  a   c 
5.4 7.1 
```

* Or slices of the vector:

```r
x[1:4]
```

```
  a   b   c   d 
5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 
```

* The `:` operator creates a sequence of numbers from the left element to the right.

```r
1:4
```

```
[1] 1 2 3 4
```

```r
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

```
[1] 1 2 3 4
```


========================================================
### Accessing elements using their indices -- continued

* We can ask for the same element multiple times:


```r
x[c(1,1,3)]
```

```
  a   a   c 
5.4 5.4 7.1 
```

* If we ask for an index beyond the length of the vector, R will return a missing value:

```r
x[6]
```

```
<NA> 
  NA 
```

* This is a vector of length one containing an `NA`, whose name is also `NA`.

========================================================
### Accessing elements using their indices -- continued

* If we ask for the 0th element, we get an empty vector:

```r
x[0]
```

```
named numeric(0)
```

* In many programming languages (C and Python, for example), the first element of a vector has an index of 0. 

* In R, the first element is 1.


========================================================

## Skipping and removing elements

* If we use a negative number as the index of a vector, R will return every element *except* for the one specified:

```r
x[-2]
```

```
  a   c   d   e 
5.4 7.1 4.8 7.5 
```

* We can skip multiple elements:

```r
x[c(-1, -5)]  # or x[-c(1,5)]
```

```
  b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8 
```

* A common trip up for novices occurs when trying to skip slices of a vector. 

* It's natural to try to negate a slice as follows

```r
x[-1:3]
```
 
* But this gives a somewhat cryptic error...

```
Error in x[-1:3]: only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
```


========================================================
### Skipping and removing elements -- continued

* The key to understanding this is remembering the order of operations. 

   * `:` is really a function, which we want to respect the arguments of.

* It takes its first argument as -1, and its second as 3, so generates the sequence of numbers: `c(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3)`.

* The correct solution is to wrap that function call in brackets, so that the `-` operator applies to the result:


```r
x[-(1:3)]
```

```
  d   e 
4.8 7.5 
```

* To remove elements from a vector, we need to assign the result back into the variable:

```r
x <- x[-4]
x
```

```
  a   b   c   e 
5.4 6.2 7.1 7.5 
```


========================================================

## Subsetting by name

* We can extract elements by using their name, instead of extracting by index:


```r
x <- c(a=5.4, b=6.2, c=7.1, d=4.8, e=7.5) # we can name a vector 'on the fly'
x[c("a", "c")]
```

```
  a   c 
5.4 7.1 
```

* This is usually a much more reliable way to subset objects: 

  * the position of various elements can often change when chaining together subsetting operations, but the names will always remain the same.


========================================================

## Subsetting through other logical operations <a name="logical-operations"></a>

* We can also use any logical vector to subset:


```r
x[c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

```
  c   e 
7.1 7.5 
```

* Since comparison operators (e.g. `>`, `<`, `==`) evaluate to logical vectors, we can also use them to succinctly subset vectors: 

  * the following statement gives the same result as the previous one.


```r
x[x > 7]
```

```
  c   e 
7.1 7.5 
```

========================================================

## Subsetting through other logical operations <a name="logical-operations"></a>

* Breaking it down, this statement first evaluates `x>7`, 
  
  * generating a logical vector `c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`, 
  
  * and then selects the elements of `x` corresponding to the `TRUE` values.

* We can use `==` to mimic the previous method of indexing by name (remember you have to use `==` rather than `=` for comparisons):

```r
x[names(x) == "a"]
```

```
  a 
5.4 
```

========================================================
### Combining logical conditions

* We often want to combine multiple logical criteria. 

* For example, we might want to find all the countries that are located in Asia **or** Europe **and** have life expectancies within a certain range. 

* Several operations for combining logical vectors exist in R:
 
 * `&`, the "logical AND" operator: returns `TRUE` if both the left and right are `TRUE`.
 * `|`, the "logical OR" operator: returns `TRUE`, if either the left or right (or both) are `TRUE`.


========================================================
### Combining logical conditions

* You may sometimes see `&&` and `||` instead of `&` and `|`. 

* These two-character operators only look at the first element of each vector and ignore the remaining elements. In general you should not use the two-character operators in data analysis; 

* save them for programming, i.e. deciding whether to execute a statement.

* `!`, the "logical NOT" operator: converts `TRUE` to `FALSE` and `FALSE` to `TRUE`. 

* It can negate a single logical condition (eg `!TRUE` becomes `FALSE`), or a whole vector of conditions(eg `!c(TRUE, FALSE)` becomes `c(FALSE, TRUE)`).

* Additionally, you can compare the elements within a single vector using the `all` function (which returns `TRUE` if every element of the vector is `TRUE`)  and the `any` function (which returns `TRUE` if one or more elements of the  vector are `TRUE`).



========================================================

### Non-unique names

* You should be aware that it is possible for multiple elements in a vector to have the same name. (For a data frame, columns can have the same name; 

* Consider this example:

```r
 x <- 1:3
 x
```

```
[1] 1 2 3
```

```r
names(x) <- c('a', 'a', 'a')
x
```

```
a a a 
1 2 3 
```

========================================================

### Non-unique names

* Now consider if we try to extract data by name when all elements have the same name:


```r
x['a']  # only returns first value
```

```
a 
1 
```

```r
x[names(x) == 'a']  # returns all three values
```

```
a a a 
1 2 3 
```


========================================================

## Skipping named elements

* Skipping or removing named elements is a little harder. If we try to skip one named element by negating the string, R complains (slightly obscurely) that it doesn't know how to take the negative of a string:

```r
x <- c(a=5.4, b=6.2, c=7.1, d=4.8, e=7.5) # we start again by naming a vector 'on the fly'
x[-"a"]
```

```
Error in -"a": invalid argument to unary operator
```

* However, we can use the `!=` (not-equals) operator to construct a logical vector that will do what we want:


```r
x[names(x) != "a"]
```

```
  b   c   d   e 
6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5 
```


========================================================

## Skipping named elements

* Skipping multiple named indices is a little bit harder still. Suppose we want to drop the `"a"` and `"c"` elements, so we try this:

```r
x[names(x)!=c("a","c")]
```

```
  b   c   d   e 
6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5 
```

* R did *something*, but it gave us a warning that we ought to pay attention to - and it apparently *gave us the wrong answer* (the `"c"` element is still included in the vector)!

 * So what does `!=` actually do in this case? That's an excellent question...

========================================================

### Recycling

* Let's take a look at the comparison component of this code:


```r
names(x) != c("a", "c")
```

```
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

* When you use `!=`, R tries to compare each element of the left argument with the corresponding element of its right
argument. 

* What happens when you compare vectors of different lengths?


========================================================

### Recycling -- continued

<ul>
  <li>In this case R <b>repeats</b> `c("a", "c")` as many times as necessary to match `names(x)`, i.e. we get `c("a","c","a","c","a")`. </li>
  <li> Since the recycled `"a"` doesn't match the third element of `names(x)`, the value of `!=` is `TRUE`.</li>
  <li> Because in this case the longer vector length (5) isn't a multiple of the shorter vector length (2), R printed a warning message. </li>
  <li> If we had been unlucky and `names(x)` had contained six elements, R would <b>silently</b> have done the wrong thing (i.e., not what we intended it to do).</li>
  <li>This recycling rule can can introduce hard-to-find and subtle bugs.</li>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================

### Recycling

* The way to get R to do what we really want (match *each* element of the left argument with *all* of the elements of the right argument) it to use the `%in%` operator. 

* The `%in%` operator goes through each element of its left argument, in this case the names of `x`, and asks, "Does this element occur in the second argument?". 

* Here, since we want to *exclude* values, we also need a `!` operator to change "in" to "not in":

```r
x[! names(x) %in% c("a","c") ]
```

```
  b   d   e 
6.2 4.8 7.5 
```

========================================================
## Handling special values

* At some point you will encounter functions in R that cannot handle missing, infinite,
or undefined data.

* There are a number of special functions you can use to filter out this data:

 * `is.na` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   containing `NA` (or `NaN`)
 * likewise, `is.nan`, and `is.infinite` will do the same for `NaN` and `Inf`.
 * `is.finite` will return all positions in a vector, matrix, or data.frame
   that do not contain `NA`, `NaN` or `Inf`.
 * `na.omit` will filter out all missing values from a vector

========================================================

## Factor subsetting

* Now that we've explored the different ways to subset vectors, how do we subset the other data structures?

* Factor subsetting works the same way as vector subsetting.

```r
f <- factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c", "c", "d"))
f[f == "a"]
```

```
[1] a a
Levels: a b c d
```

```r
f[f %in% c("b", "c")]
```

```
[1] b c c
Levels: a b c d
```

```r
f[1:3]
```

```
[1] a a b
Levels: a b c d
```



========================================================
## Factor subsetting -- continued

* Skipping elements will not remove the level even if no more of that category exists in the factor:

```r
f[-3]
```

```
[1] a a c c d
Levels: a b c d
```

========================================================

## Matrix subsetting

* Matrices are also subsetted using the `[` function. In this case it takes two arguments: the first applying to the rows, the second to its columns:

```r
set.seed(1)
m <- matrix(rnorm(6*4), ncol=4, nrow=6)
m[3:4, c(3,1)]
```

```
            [,1]       [,2]
[1,]  1.12493092 -0.8356286
[2,] -0.04493361  1.5952808
```

* You can leave the first or second arguments blank to retrieve all the rows or columns respectively:

```r
m[, c(3,4)]
```

```
            [,1]        [,2]
[1,] -0.62124058  0.82122120
[2,] -2.21469989  0.59390132
[3,]  1.12493092  0.91897737
[4,] -0.04493361  0.78213630
[5,] -0.01619026  0.07456498
[6,]  0.94383621 -1.98935170
```

========================================================
### Matrix subsetting -- continued

* If we only access one row or column, R will automatically convert the result
to a vector:

```r
m[3,]
```

```
[1] -0.8356286  0.5757814  1.1249309  0.9189774
```

* If you want to keep the output as a matrix, you need to specify a *third* argument;
`drop = FALSE`:


```r
m[3, , drop=FALSE]
```

```
           [,1]      [,2]     [,3]      [,4]
[1,] -0.8356286 0.5757814 1.124931 0.9189774
```

========================================================
### Matrix subsetting -- continued

* Unlike vectors, if we try to access a row or column outside of the matrix,
R will throw an error:


```r
m[, c(3,6)]
```

```
Error in m[, c(3, 6)]: subscript out of bounds
```

* When dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, each argument to `[`  corresponds to a dimension. For example, a 3D array, the first three  arguments correspond to the rows, columns, and depth dimension.


========================================================
### Matrix subsetting -- continued

* Because matrices are vectors, we can also subset using only one argument:

```r
m[5]
```

```
[1] 0.3295078
```


* This usually isn't useful, and often confusing to read. However it is useful to note that matrices are laid out in *column-major format* by default. 

* That is the elements of the vector are arranged column-wise:


```r
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3)
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6
```


========================================================
### Matrix subsetting -- continued

* If you wish to populate the matrix by row, use `byrow=TRUE`:


```r
matrix(1:6, nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    2    3
[2,]    4    5    6
```

* Matrices can also be subsetted using their rownames and column names instead of their row and column indices.

========================================================

## List subsetting

* Now we'll introduce some new subsetting operators. There are three functions used to subset lists. We've already seen these when learning about atomic vectors and matrices:  `[`, `[[`, and `$`.

* Using `[` will always return a list. If you want to *subset* a list, but not *extract* an element, then you will likely use `[`.


```r
xlist <- list(a = "Software Carpentry", b = 1:10, data = head(iris))
xlist[1]
```

```
$a
[1] "Software Carpentry"
```

* This returns a *list with one element*.

* To extract individual elements of a list, you need to use the double-square bracket function: `[[`.


```r
xlist[[1]]
```

```
[1] "Software Carpentry"
```


========================================================
### List subsetting -- continued

* You can't extract more than one element at once:

```r
xlist[[1:2]]
```

```
Error in xlist[[1:2]]: subscript out of bounds
```

* Nor use it to skip elements:

```r
xlist[[-1]]
```

```
Error in xlist[[-1]]: attempt to select more than one element in get1index <real>
```

* But you can use names to both subset and extract elements:

```r
xlist[["a"]]
```

```
[1] "Software Carpentry"
```

========================================================
### List subsetting -- continued

* The `$` function is a shorthand way for extracting elements by name:

```r
xlist$data
```

```
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
```

========================================================
## Data frames

* Remember the data frames are lists underneath the hood, so similar rules apply. 

* However they are also two dimensional objects:

  * `[` with one argument will act the same way as for lists, where each list element corresponds to a column. 
  
  * The resulting object will be a data frame:


```r
require(gapminder)
head(gapminder[3])
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 1
   year
  <int>
1  1952
2  1957
3  1962
4  1967
5  1972
6  1977
```

* Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:


```r
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
```

```
[1] 28.801 30.332 31.997 34.020 36.088 38.438
```

========================================================
### Data frames -- continued


* The `$` symbol provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:


```r
head(gapminder$year)
```

```
[1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977
```

* With two arguments, `[` behaves the same way as for matrices:


```r
gapminder[1:3,]
```

```
# A tibble: 3 x 6
  country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
  <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.
3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
```

========================================================
### Data frames -- continued


* If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because the elements are mixed types):


```r
gapminder[3,]
```

```
# A tibble: 1 x 6
  country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
  <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
```

* But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can be changed with the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).



========================================================
### Data frames -- continued


* Most of R's functions are vectorized, meaning that the function will operate on all elements of a vector without needing to loop through and act on each element one at a time. 

* This makes writing code more concise, easy to read, and less error prone.



```r
x <- 1:4
x * 2
```

```
[1] 2 4 6 8
```

* The multiplication happened to each element of the vector.

========================================================
## Vectorization

* We can also add two vectors together:


```r
y <- 6:9
x + y
```

```
[1]  7  9 11 13
```

* Each element of `x` was added to its corresponding element of `y`:


```r
x:  1  2  3  4
    +  +  +  +
y:  6  7  8  9
---------------
    7  9 11 13
```

* Comparison operators, logical operators, and many functions are also vectorized:


```r
x > 2
```

```
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
```

```r
a <- x > 3  # or, for clarity, a <- (x > 3)
a
```

```
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```

========================================================

## Vectorization and performance

* R, while having the benefit of being an easy-to-learn language with powerful software, is not especially fast.

* For many users, this doesn't pose an obstacle however as the vectorization of the language can actually make many computations in R competitive.

  * When a mathematic operation or function is run as a vectorized operation, the computer calls underlying C code that has been optimized for performance.
  
  * This is the same performance-gain technique that is used in, e.g., MATLAB and Python.

* Though we have not discussed ```FOR``` loops yet, we will mention now that in general you should always try to write your operations vector-wise instead of with ```FOR``` loops in R.


========================================================

### A remark on element-wise vs. matrix multiplication

* <strong>Very important:</strong> the operator `*` gives you element-wise multiplication!
* To do matrix multiplication, we need to use the `%*%` operator:


```r
m %*% matrix(1, nrow=4, ncol=1)
```

```
            [,1]
[1,]  0.06095586
[2,] -0.69883054
[3,]  1.78406103
[4,]  2.02709511
[5,]  1.89966366
[6,] -1.47614063
```

```r
matrix(1:4, nrow=1) %*% matrix(1:4, ncol=1)
```

```
     [,1]
[1,]   30
```
* For more on matrix algebra, see the [Quick-R reference guide](http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/matrix.html)
