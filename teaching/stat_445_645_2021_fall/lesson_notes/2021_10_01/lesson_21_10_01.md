## Confidence intervals

* Recall again the <b>sampling distribution</b> for the sample mean; 

  * if we can write the <strong>distribution for the sample statistic</strong> as approximately $N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)$, 

* we can identify <strong>with some probability</strong> <b>how accurate our estimate for the true mean</b> is. 

* The <b>standard error</b> is defined as the <strong>standard deviation of this sample statistic distribution, i.e., $\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}$</strong>.
  
  * this quantifies how far an observed realization is likely to lie away from the true parameter.

* The standard error of the sample mean measures the accuracy of the estimation of the mean,

  * Respectively, <b>confidence intervals</b> <strong>quantify how close the sample mean is expected to be to the population mean</strong>. 

* We will recall how to construct confidence intervals for the mean of a normal distribution.

========================================================
### Confidence intervals continued

<div style="width:50%; float:left">
<ul>
  <li>Consider a normal population with an <b style="color:#1b9e77">unknown mean $\mu$</b> and <b style="color:#d95f02">known standard deviation $\sigma$</b>.</li>
  <li> Let $X_i \sim N\left(\mu, \sigma^2 \right)$ for $i = 1, \cdots, n$ be the sample rv’s. </li>
  <li> Then for the sample mean of the random variables 
  $$\begin{align}
  \overline{X}_n &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\
  \overline{X}_n &\sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
  \end{align}$$</li>
  <li> Moreover, we can show that by <b>standardizing the sample mean</b> of the random variables, shifting to mean zero and dividing by the standard deviation, we have
  $$\sqrt{n}\frac{\overline{X}_n -\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0, 1)$$</li>
  <li>Now, let $z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ be defined such that for $Z \sim N(0, 1)$
    $$P\left(-z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\leq Z \leq z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right) = 1 - \alpha$$
  </li>
  <li>Such a choice exists by the symmetry of the standard normal distribution about zero,</li>

========================================================
### Confidence intervals continued

* Using the results from the last slide, we can say that for $Z= \sqrt{n}\frac{\overline{X}_n -\mu}{\sigma}$,

  $$\begin{align}
  & P\left(-z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\leq Z \leq z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right) = 1 - \alpha \\
  \Leftrightarrow & P\left(-z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\leq \sqrt{n}\frac{\overline{X}_n -\mu}{\sigma} \leq z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right) = 1 - \alpha
  \end{align}$$
  
* We will re-write the interval in the above as follows:
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \left(-z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\leq \overline{X}_n -\mu \leq z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) &=  \left(-\overline{X}_n -z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\leq  -\mu \leq -\overline{X}_n+ z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \\
  &= \left(\overline{X}_n -z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\leq  \mu \leq \overline{X}_n+ z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  
* From the above statement, we can read that
  <blockquote>
  Upon replication of a sample of size $n$, the random interval
  $$\left(\overline{X}_n -z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\leq  \mu \leq \overline{X}_n+ z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$
  has a probability of $1-\alpha$ of covering $\mu$.  Particularly, for a given observed sample mean $\overline{x}_n$, constructing a confidence interval as above will keep $\overline{x}_n$ within a radius of $z_{1−\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ from the true value $\mu$ $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$ of the time over infinite replications.
  </blockquote>
  
========================================================

### Confidence intervals continued

<div style="float:left; width:60%">
<ul>
  <li>What we are imagining when we construct confidence intervals is the following.</li>
  <li>Based on some <b>particular sample</b> $X_{j,1},\cdots, X_{j,n}$ of size $n$ indexed by $j$, we will get some <strong>particular value for the confidence interval</strong>.</li>
  <li>If we <b>replicate the sample of size</b> $n$, indexed by $j$, we will almost surely find a <strong>new confidence interval based on each replicate</strong>.</li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:60%">
<ul>
  <li>Our goal in constructing a confidence interval is thus to <b>catch the true parameter value</b> with the <strong>confidence level $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$ out of all replicates</strong>.</li>
  <li>If we want higher confidence, we need wider intervals to catch the true value.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
  <li>However, the normal confidence interval,
  $$\overline{X} - \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}z_\frac{\alpha}{2} \leq  \mu  \leq  \overline{X} + \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} z_\frac{\alpha}{2}$$
  also has a <strong>width that depends on the sample size</strong>.</li>
  <li>This is of course, as we discussed in the central limit theorem, the precision of the sample mean $\overline{X}$ increases for larger sample sizes, with a <b>standard deviation that shrinks at a rate like $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$</b>.</li>
  <li>This allows us to select a sample size for a target precision, given a level of confidence.</li>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================
### Confidence intervals continued

* The issue with the mentioned approach to confidence intervals is that the <b style="color:#1b9e77">true population value of $\sigma$ is almost never known</b> in any practical application.

* For this reason, we can pass to the <b>student's t-distribution</b> again.

* Recall that we showed that for the sample mean of the normal random variables $\overline{X}_n$; and

* the sample standard deviation of the normal random variables $S$,
  
  $$\frac{\overline{X}_n - \mu}{\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim t_{n-1}.$$
  
* Therefore, in practice we can construct the same type of random interval but for a <b>$t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ critical value of $t_{n-1}$</b>,
  $$\left(\overline{X}_n -t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\leq  \mu \leq \overline{X}_n+ t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\right).$$

* The above derivation is at the basis of practical confidence intervals for the population mean.

* A related, <strong>dual concept</strong> is the <b>hypothesis test for the mean</b>.


========================================================
## Hypothesis testing 

<ul>
    <li>Suppose we are <b>estimating the population</b> mean $\mu$, and we have some <strong>hypothesis as to what the value might be</strong>, $\tilde{\mu}$.</li>
      <li>Let us suppose we created a $95\%$ confidence interval,
      $$\left(\overline{X} - \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}, \overline{X} + \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)$$
      and upon comparing with some realization $\overline{x}$ we found that $\tilde{\mu}$  <strong>was not in this region</strong>.</li> 
      <li>If we are following the procedure correctly, and if the $\tilde{\mu}$ was actually equal to the true population $\mu$, then
      $$\tilde{\mu} \text{ not in } \left(\overline{X} - \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}, \overline{X} + \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) $$
      only $5\%$ of the time.</li>
   <li>If we were to find that $\tilde{\mu}$ was actually in our confidence intervals in far less than $5\%$ of replications, this should question if $\tilde{\mu}$ was really a good hypothesis for the true $\mu$.</li>
   <li>In this sense, $\alpha$ represents a kind of criterion if we should question if a proposed value of $\tilde{\mu}$ is really appropriate.</li> 
</ul>


========================================================
### Hypothesis testing -- introduction

* Formally, we will define

<blockquote>
<b>Statistical Hypothesis</b><br>
A <strong>statistical hypothesis</strong> is a statement about the parameters of one or more populations.
</blockquote>

* In hypothesis testing, the null and alternative hypotheses have special meanings philosophically and in the mathematics.

* <b>We cannot generally "prove" a hypothesis to be true</b>;

  * generically, we will assume that the true population parameter is unobservable.
  
* Instead, <strong>we can only determine if a hypothesis seems unlikely enough to reject</strong>;

  * this is similar to finding that our proposed parameter value was in far-fewer confidence intervals than predicted by the procedure.

* To begin such a test formally, we need to first <b>make some assumption about the true parameter</b>.

  * This always takes the form of <strong>assuming the null hypothesis</strong> $H_0$.

* The <b>null hypothesis</b> $H_0$ will always <strong>take the form of an equality, or an inclusive inequality</strong>.

  * That is, we take
  
  $$\begin{align}
  H_0: & \theta \text{ is } (= / \leq / \geq) \text{ some proposed value}.
  \end{align}$$


========================================================
### Hypothesis testing -- introduction


* The contradictory / competing hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis, written

  $$\begin{align}
  H_1: & \theta \text{ is } (\neq / > / <) \text{ some proposed value}
  \end{align}$$
  

* Once we have formed a null and alternative hypothesis: 

  $$\begin{align}
  H_0: & \theta \text{ is } (= / \leq / \geq) \text{ some proposed value}\\
  H_1: & \theta \text{ is } (\neq / > / <) \text{ some proposed value}
  \end{align}$$

* we <b>use the sample data</b> to <strong>consider how likely or unlikely it was to observe such data with the proposed parameter</strong>.

  * If the <strong>sample doesn't seem to fit the proposed parameter value</strong>, we <b>deem the null hypothesis unlikely</b>.

* If the <b>null hypothesis is sufficiently unlikely</b>, <strong>we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis</strong>.

* However, if the evidence (the sample) doesn't contradict the null hypothesis, we tentatively keep this assumption.

  * This <strong>has not proven this assumption</strong>, it has only said that the <b>hypothesis is not unlikely given our evidence</b>.

========================================================
### Decision citeria for hypothesis testing -- types of errors

<div style="float:left; width:60%">
<ul>
  <li>Our decision process is based on the random outcome of the test statistic, so that even if an outcome seems unlikely, we may come to a false conclusion based on observing a low-probability event.</li>
  <li> There are <b>two possible wrong conclusions</b> we can make in this decision process:</li>
  <ol>
    <li> we may <strong>reject the null hypothesis when this is actually true</strong>;</li>
    <blockquote>
  <b>Type I Error</b><br>
    Rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$ when it is true is defined as a <strong>type I error</strong>.
  </blockquote>
    <li> we may <strong>fail to reject the null hypothesis when this is actually false</strong>.</li>
  <blockquote>
  <b>Type II Error</b><br>
  Failing to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ when it is false is defined as a <strong>type II error</strong>.
  </blockquote>
  </ol>
  <li>A schematic of this hypothesis testing decision process is given in the right:</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<img src="error_table.png" style="width:100%"  alt="Confidence interval replications.">
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
  <li>Based on these two possible errors, we can define different probabilistic criteria that will attempt to handle these risks of incorrect decisions.</li>
  <li>It turns out that the rate of failure of confidence intervals is the same as the probability of type I error.</li>
  <blockquote>
  <b>Probability of Type I Error</b><br>
  $$\alpha = P(\text{type I error}) = P(\text{reject }H_0\text{ when }H_0\text{ is true})$$
  </blockquote>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================
### Decision citeria for hypothesis testing -- types of errors

* In evaluating a hypothesis-testing procedure, it is also important to examine the probability
of a type II error, which we denote by $\beta$.


<blockquote>
  <b>Probability of Type II Error</b><br>
  $$\beta = P(\text{type II error}) = P(\text{failing to reject }H_0\text{ when }H_0\text{ is false}).$$
  The complementary probability, $1- \beta$ is called the <strong>power</strong> of the hypothesis test.
  </blockquote>
  
* To calculate $\beta$, we must have a <b>specific alternative hypothesis</b>;

  * that is, <strong>we must have a particular value</strong> of $\mu$.
  
* This is because, the unknown, true alternative hypothesis for $\mu$ will determine the sampling distribution for $\overline{X}$.

* From this sampling distribution, we compute the appropriate probability for failing to reject our null hypothesis, given the true distribution with respect to the true alternative.
  



========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean

* Student’s t test can be used in R through the function `t.test()`, which will include the dual confidence interval.


* Specifically, if we have a formal hypothesis test

  $$\begin{align}
  H_0:\mu = \tilde{\mu} & &
  H_1:  \mu \neq \tilde{\mu};
  \end{align}$$
  and if the variance $\sigma^2$ is also unknown;
  
* then assuming the null, we write the acceptance region as

   $$\left( \tilde{\mu} - \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2} , \tilde{\mu} + \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}\right).$$
   
* If the sample mean $\overline{X}$ lies outside of the acceptance region, i.e., in the critical region,

 $$\left(-\infty,  \tilde{\mu} - \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \cup \left( \tilde{\mu} + \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}, \infty\right),$$
 
 * we reject the null hypothesis with $\alpha \times 100\%$ significance.
 
* Alternatively, if the sample mean lies within the acceptance region, we fail to reject the null hypothesis with $\alpha\times 100\%$ significance.


========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* The sodium content of twenty 300-gram boxes of organic cornflakes was determined. 

* The data (in milligrams) are as follows:


```r
sodium_sample <- c(131.15, 130.69, 130.91, 129.54, 129.64, 128.77,130.72, 128.33, 128.24, 129.65, 130.14, 129.29, 128.71, 129.00, 129.39, 130.42, 129.53, 130.12, 129.78, 130.92)
```

* Let's suppose we want to test the hypothesis,

  $$\begin{align}
  H_0: \mu = 130 & & H_1:\mu \neq 130;
  \end{align}$$

* If we use `t.test()` directly, notice the output


```r
t.test(sodium_sample)
```

```

	One Sample t-test

data:  sodium_sample
t = 662.06, df = 19, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 129.3368 130.1572
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  129.747 
```

========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* Rather, to set the correct null and alternative hypothesis, we write,


```r
t.test(sodium_sample, mu=130, alternative="two.sided")
```

```

	One Sample t-test

data:  sodium_sample
t = -1.291, df = 19, p-value = 0.2122
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 130
95 percent confidence interval:
 129.3368 130.1572
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  129.747 
```

* Notice that the above includes the test statistic $t_0 = -1.291$.

  * This also lists the number of degrees of freedom $df= n-1 = 19$ for the t distribtion.
  
* Most importantly, this lists the P value, $\approx 0.2122$.

* If we take $\alpha=0.05$, a common convention, we say $P> \alpha$, such that <strong>we fail to reject the null hypothesis of $\mu = 130$</strong>.


========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* Suppose we wanted to perform a hypothesis test to make sure the mean sodium is not too high;

  * if we wanted to evaluate the one-sided hypothesis test

  $$\begin{align}
  H_0: \mu \leq 130 & & H_1:\mu >130,
  \end{align}$$
  
* we would write in R


```r
t.test(sodium_sample, mu=130, alternative="greater")
```

```

	One Sample t-test

data:  sodium_sample
t = -1.291, df = 19, p-value = 0.8939
alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 130
95 percent confidence interval:
 129.4081      Inf
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  129.747 
```

* Here, we once again fail to reject the null hypothesis at $\alpha\times 100\% = 5\%$ significance, as $P\approx 0.89$.


========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* Computing the power of a t test or the sample size necessary for a hypothesis test to reach a certain power is complicated to perform analytically, and is more practically done with technology.

* There is a built-in feature in R that will compute either the power of a test, or the needed sample size to attain a power, with the t test.

* The `power.t.test()` takes the following arguments

```
power.t.test(n, delta, sd, sig.level, power, alternative, type="one.sample")
```

* where 
  * `n` is the sample size
  * `delta` is the difference between the assumed, but untrue, null hypothesis and the unknown, but assumed true, alternative hypothesis;
  * `sd` is the the sample standard deviation;
  * `sig.level` is the value of $\alpha$;
  * `power` is the power of the test;
  * `alternative` is the alternative hypothesis; and
  * we need to specify the `type="one.sample"` as above.


========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* When we enter the `power.t.test()`,

```
power.t.test(n, delta, sd, sig.level, power, alternative, type="one.sample")
```

* we will  actually leave out one of:
  1. `power`; or
  2.  `n`

* as an argument.

* The argument that is left out, `power` or `n`, will be computed from the other arguments.

* We will continue our example with the sodium sample, now evaluating the power of our earlier tests


```r
t.test(sodium_sample, mu=130, alternative="two.sided")
```

```

	One Sample t-test

data:  sodium_sample
t = -1.291, df = 19, p-value = 0.2122
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 130
95 percent confidence interval:
 129.3368 130.1572
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  129.747 
```
  
========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* In our sodium sample example, we had


```r
s <- sd(sodium_sample)
n <- length(sodium_sample)
mu_null <- 130.0
```

* Suppose we have a specific value for the alternative hypothesis in mind, i.e., 


```r
mu_alternative <- 130.5
```


* and we wish to determine the power of the test to reject the false, null hypothesis.

* We will leave the `power` argument blank in the function, but we need to calculate `delta`.

* `delta` is given as the absolute difference between our false null hypothesis, and the true alternative, i.e.,


```r
delta <- abs(mu_null - mu_alternative)
delta
```

```
[1] 0.5
```



========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* To calculate the power of the hypothesis test,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  H_0 : \mu = 130 & & H_1:\mu \neq 130
  \end{align}$$

* where we assume the true alternative hypothesis is $H_1: \mu=130.5$,

* with a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$,

* we can compute this at once witht the `power.t.test()` as:


```r
power.t.test(n=n, delta=delta, sd=s, sig.level=0.05, power=NULL, type="one.sample")
```

```

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 20
          delta = 0.5
             sd = 0.8764288
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.6775708
    alternative = two.sided
```



========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples


* Suppose we want to calculate power of the same type of hypothesis test, but with a different, one-sided alternative hypothesis.

  * e.g., 
  
  $$\begin{align}
  H_0:\mu \leq 130 & & H_1 :\mu > 130.
  \end{align}$$
  
* We specify this in the function as,


```r
power.t.test(n=n, delta=delta, sd=s, alternative="one.sided" , sig.level=0.05, power=NULL, type="one.sample")
```

```

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 20
          delta = 0.5
             sd = 0.8764288
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.7921742
    alternative = one.sided
```

========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* On the other hand, suppose we need to find the sample size necessary to meet a certain power with one of the earlier hypothesis tests.

* E.g., we might try to reject the null if a true mean sodium content is actually 130.1 milligrams, with a power of the test equal to 0.75.

* To do so, we now need to negelct the sample size argument `n` and supply the power argument `power`.

* The needed arguments are assigned below:


```r
s <- sd(sodium_sample)
mu_null <- 130.0
mu_alternative <- 130.1
delta <- abs(mu_null - mu_alternative)
pow <- 0.75
```


========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* We determine the appropriate sample size via


```r
power.t.test(n=NULL, delta=delta, sd=s, power=pow, type="one.sample")
```

```

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 535.0307
          delta = 0.1
             sd = 0.8764288
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.75
    alternative = two.sided
```

* for the two-sided test, or for the one-sided test we use


```r
power.t.test(n=NULL, delta=delta, sd=s, alternative="one.sided", power=pow, type="one.sample")
```

```

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 414.5589
          delta = 0.1
             sd = 0.8764288
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.75
    alternative = one.sided
```
