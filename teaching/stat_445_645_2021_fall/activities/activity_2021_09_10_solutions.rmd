We will need both of the below for these activities.
```{r}
require(gapminder)
require(ggplot2)
```



### Activity 1: plotting in ggplot2


Let's consider a plot below, where we use the `facet_wrap` with the `country` argument to plot the life expectancy versus year for all countries in the "Americas" region. 

```{r}
americas <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas",]
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country)
```

To clean this figure up for a publication we need to change some of the text elements.  The x-axis is too cluttered, and the y axis should read "Life expectancy", rather than the column name in the data frame.  We can do this by adding a couple of different layers. The **theme** layer controls the axis text, and overall text size. 



Labels for the axes, plot title and any legend can be set using the `labs` function. Legend titles
are set using the same names we used in the `aes` specification.  Thus below the color legend title is set using `color = "Continent"`, while the title
of a fill legend would be set using `fill = "MyTitle"`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",              # x axis title
    y = "Life expectancy",   # y axis title
    title = "Figure 1",      # main title of figure
    color = "Continent"      # title of legend
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```


This is a taste of what you can do with ggplot2. RStudio provides a
really useful [cheat sheet][cheat] of the different layers available, and more
extensive documentation is available on the [ggplot2 website][ggplot-doc].
Finally, if you have no idea how to change something, a quick internet search will
usually send you to a relevant question and answer on Stack Overflow with reusable
code to modify!

#### Question 1:

Try using the facet_wrap feature in ggplot2 to plot the life expectancies over time for all countries, but sorted by regions into sub-plots.  Use a scatter plot to picture life expectancies versus time, but where the points are colored by continent.  Finally, use the `geom_smooth` command to plot a linear model trend in each sub-plot.  The title should explain immediately the important information in the picture, with good, descriptive axis labels.  Use the `theme()` command to make sure the tick labels are also clear.


Note, if you want to save your plot to a file "regional_life_trends.png" you can use the command below where life_trend_plt is the plotting object assigned by the ggplot command.
```{r eval=FALSE}
# saving the figure to an output file, "regional_life_trends.png"
ggsave(filename = "regional_life_trends.png", 
       plot = life_trend_plt, width = 18, height = 15, 
       dpi = 300, units = "cm")
```



##### Solution to question 1:
```{r}
life_trend_plt <- ggplot(data=gapminder, 
                         aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
                  geom_point() +
                  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')  + facet_wrap(~continent) +
                  labs(
    x = "Year",                                # x axis title
    y = "Life expectancy",                     # y axis title
    title = "Regional life expectancy trends", # main title of figure
    color = "Region"                           # title of legend
  ) +
                  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

life_trend_plt
```


#### Question 2:

Repeat the above question but plotting a different relationship, with the same sub-plots organized by continent.  You may re-use a relationship other than life expectancy that you may have used in a different exercise.
