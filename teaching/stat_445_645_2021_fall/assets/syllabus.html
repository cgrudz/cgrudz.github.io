<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Announcements and course updates will be posted in <a href="https://unr.canvaslms.com/login/canvas" target="blank">Canvas</a>. Students are expected to keep up-to-date on the course by reading these announcements for important information on assignments, midterms, etc.</p>
<div id="help-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Help &amp; Questions</h3>
<p>There will be a classroom discussion forum where you can seek help from the instructor and peers about the assignments. Some assignments will require that you post and discuss results in this forum.</p>
<p>The best way to contact the instructor is via email or message within Canvas. Messages received before 4:00 PM during business days will usually get a response the same day. Emails received after 4:00 PM or during the weekend are not guaranteed a same-day response. Longer questions will not be answered by email and will be directed to appointments or office hours.</p>
<p>The instructor will be <strong>available from 4:00 - 5:30 PM MonWed for public office hours and questions, shared with students from STAT 775</strong>. If you cannot attend office hours or if you need to discuss something privately you can set an appointment with the instructor directly.</p>
</div>
<div id="netiquette" class="section level3">
<h3>Netiquette</h3>
<p>When communicating online, you should always:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Treat your instructor and peers with respect, even in email or in any other online communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Use clear and concise language. Be respective of readers’ time and attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that all college level communication should have correct spelling and grammar.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid slang terms and texting abbreviations.</p></li>
<li><p>Use standard fonts that are optimized for online reading (e.g., sans serif) along with a consistent and readable size (12 or 14 pt.)</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using the caps lock feature AS IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS YELLING.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit and possibly avoid the use of emoticons. Not everyone knows how to interpret them.</p></li>
<li><p>Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm as tone is sometimes lost in an email or discussion post and your message might be taken literally or offensively.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful sharing personal information online (both yours and other’s).</p></li>
<li><p>Always give proper credit when referencing or quoting another source. (Corollary: Don’t copy and paste another student’s post and claim it as original as that is essentially plagiarism.)</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t repeat someone else’s post without adding something of your own to it. (See corollary above regarding reuse of someone else’s post.)</p></li>
<li><p>Always be respectful of others’ opinions even when they differ from your own. When you disagree with someone, you should express your differing opinion in a respectful, non-critical way. (Corollary: Do not make personal or insulting remarks.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>This course introduces students to computational statistical methods within a modern computing environment. The first part of this course will be devoted to learning the R language and basic programming skills. The second part of this course introduces univariate statistical analysis including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing in R. The third part of this course introduces basic concepts and computational techniques in matrix algebra, numerical analysis and optimization, and for analyzing and simulating multivariate distributions. In the fourth and last part of this course, students are introduced to three different frameworks for statistical modeling, using linear regression, maximum likelihood estimation and Monte Carlo techniques. A final report is required for graduate students and is optional for undergraduate students as in the <a href="#final_exam_policy">final exam policy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-for-online-learning" class="section level3">
<h3>Structure for online learning</h3>
<p>This class will follow a flipped design in which students are expected to watch one or more short lectures before the class session. <strong>If a student is unable to or would prefer not to attend in-person, a HyFlex remote learning option will be granted.</strong> Video lectures will cover content that is relevant to the day’s activity in class. Class sessions will be held on Zoom and students are expected to attend the Zoom meeting to work on the day’s activities with their cohort. Students may attend the meeting in Zoom in the computer lab in DMSC 106, or may attend remotely with a computer that will accommodate the Zoom meeting and the day’s activity. The day’s activities will require posting a discussion of the results according to the assignment rubric in the forum for completion credit. Programming experience in R is not required and there will be assignments in DataCamp that will build on fundamental skills in R, in addition to our lectures and activities.</p>

<div id="late-policy-and-exceptions" class="section level2">
<h2>Late policy and exceptions</h2>
<p>There are no makeups for assignments except for university recognized activities or exceptional circumstances, as per university policy. To accommodate unforeseen circumstances, <strong>the lowest homework score and the lowest participation score will be dropped automatically from the final grade calculation</strong>. For undergraduates, a midterm score can be replaced with the final project score only once. If a student needs to miss class due to participation in official university activities or a religious observance, they <strong>must make arrangements with the instructor at least one week prior to the date in question – the absence will not be given consideration without this advanced notice</strong>. In cases of absences due to extended illness, family emergency, bereavement, or other compelling reason, students should notify the instructor as soon as possible and <strong>within one week of the start of the absence</strong>. The instructor has the right to request formal, written documentation in such cases as they deem appropriate. Please see the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/administrative-manual/3000-3999-students/3020-class-absence-policy">full policy statement on absences</a>.</p>
