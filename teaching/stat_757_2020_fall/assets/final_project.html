<p>STAT 757 – Section 1001 <br> Instructor: Colin Grudzien<br> Due: 12/14/2019 – 12:00 PM</p>
<div id="instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<blockquote>
You may work with others on this project but you must turn in your own work. You may type your solutions in any way you like (LaTeX, Markdown, Office, etc…) as long as you present your work clearly and in an organized way. Unless otherwise specified, you must hand in a printed copy of your work at the beginning of class. <strong>Whenever plotting:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Your plot must be clearly labeled in all axes, legends, and the plot must include a clear title.
</li>
<li>
The plot must be sensible and easy to read.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div id="summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For the final project, you are to revise the work of your midterm project using the more advanced perspective and tools that we have developed by the end of the course. You will once again write a research report in RMarkdown. The report must be uploaded in a PDF format to Webcampus. The report should be <b>around 10-12 pages, including figures</b>, but not including any references or appendices in this page count. Include figures and tables for the most important components of your analysis, and for explanation purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-task" class="section level3">
<h3>The task:</h3>
You will be expected to perform the following:
<ol>
<li>
Perform diagnostic analysis of your model. You should check for our usual assumptions:
<ul>
<li>
evaluate the structure of the model (e.g., nonlinearity in the relationship, residual versus fitted and partial residual plots);
</li>
<li>
discuss possible correlations in the errors (it goes beyond the scope of our class to estimate the covariance matrix, so a discussion of possible common correlations is sufficient);
</li>
<li>
constant variance of the error (residual versus fitted plots and hypothesis tests);
</li>
<li>
Gaussianity of the error (Q-Q plots and hypothesis tests);
</li>
<li>
identify outliers and evaluate for influential observations changing the fit of the model (studentized residuals, Cook’s distance).
</li>
<li>
Compute the k-fold cross validation RMSE to evaluate a more realistic estimate of predictive performance.
</li>
<li>
Not all of the above may be appropriate, so you should only include in the write-up your relevant and interesting figures. Other non-interesting results can be summarized in words or tables with the corresponding plots and code in the appendix. If a test is not performed, this choice should be justified in the context of the model with quantitative and qualitative reasoning.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Revise the model and perform remediation of the issues:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
if reasonable to do so, handle missing data systematically with methods from class;
</li>
<li>
compare the model selection in the midterm with model instead based upon an information criterion method;
</li>
<li>
if reasonable to do so, consider transformation of scale of the response with e.g., Box-Cox, shifted log, logit or Fisher’s z-transformation;
</li>
<li>
if reasonable to do so, exclude outliers and re-fit the model;
</li>
<li>
if reasonable to do so, perform generalized or weighted least squares (generalized least squares is particularly difficult in most cases, so unless you know the covariance structure of the errors already, don’t worry about estimating it or performing GLS);
</li>
<li>
if reasonable to do so, perform polynomial regression with the degree selected systematically;
</li>
<li>
finally, use the usual diagnostics to determine if the remediation has had an effect on the issues previously noted with using the usual assumptions.
</li>
<li>
Not all of the above will be reasonable to perform with your data. Some of the above remediation (like outlier exclusion) depend on the other remedial steps (like variable transformation) and should be considered simultaneously. You are encouraged to iterate on this several times, but only to summarize your process on how you arrived at your final version of the model, and how (or if) it has addressed the issues noted in the diagnostics.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Compare the goodness of fit, uncertainty, explanatory and predictive power of the new model with the model selected in the midterm. The above model evaluations should follow the same guidelines and expectations of the midterm. If you have arrived at the same model, use advanced tools such as partial residual plots to discuss the structural uncertainty of the model. Expand upon the earlier analysis to include comparisons of the effects of parameters based on, e.g., change of scale or exclusion of influential observations. Discuss the differences in predictive power observed with the confidence intervals and with the cross validation RMSE.
</li>
<li>
Make conclusions based on the above comparison. Does it appear that there is a reasonable linear signal in the data? Do these methods perform adequately for actionable prediction or explanation purposes regarding the research question? Does it suggest that other (e.g. nonlinear) methods should be used?
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="what-to-turn-in" class="section level3">
<h3>What to turn in:</h3>
<p>Your corresponding code and work should be included in the final appendix, section 8; I reserve the right to request a copy of the original analysis. If there isn’t sufficient documentation in the appendix and this cannot be provided by the student at request, the midterm will not receive any credit. Cases of plagiarism will be handled furthermore with respect to the policy on academic dishonesty.</p>
Your report should be written clearly and structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>
<b> Section 1:</b> Introduction. Discuss the data set, your opening research question and why this question is meaningful.
</li>
<li>
<b> Section 2:</b> Summarize the work performed in the midterm, the issues encountered and your plan to address these in this final work. Discuss your (possibly) revised research question and why this is meaningful.
</li>
<li>
<b> Section 3:</b> Discuss the diagnostics of the model constructed for the midterm, what assumptions may not be satisfied, and which seem to be ``OK&quot;.
</li>
<li>
<b> Section 4:</b> Discuss your remediation steps and your process of re-selecting/ fitting/ revising the model and its variables.
</li>
<li>
<b> Section 5:</b> Compare the goodness of fit, uncertainty, predictive and explanatory power of the model when revised according to the diagnostics. How does your view of the predictive and explanatory power change as you revise the model according to the diagnostics and remediation techniques?
</li>
<li>
<b> Section 6:</b> Discuss what conclusions can be made based on this analysis. Is there a reasonable <b>linear</b> signal in the data? How sure can you be of the effects in this data set? What could be performed as future work?
</li>
<li>
<b> Section 7:</b> References to data sets, papers, books or other works consulted.
</li>
<li>
<b> Section 8:</b> An appendix including relevant code and work.

<h3>Rubric</h3>
<p>The rubric below describes the necessary work delivered per category and associated points in this assignment for full credit. Reports that do not address all of these points, or give inadequate attention to these points will receive partial credit. Adequate attention is contextual and subjective, based on the problem itself and the overall work performed in the report. <strong>Students are encouraged to discuss their report in a rough draft with the instructor to get feedback on how to better address these points. Additionally, reports that do not follow document outline, do not use clear language, have formatting or writing errors, or unprofessional figures may be penalized for some of the points below.</strong></p>
