<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:

 * Variables and data types
 * Dataframes
 * Factors
 * File I/O
 * Basic plotting

* These lectures are based on the materials in [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).


========================================================

<h2>Data types</h2>

* There are 5 main types in R: 

 * double;

```{r} 
typeof(pi)
```

 * integer;

```{r}
typeof(1L)
```
 
 * complex;

```{r}
typeof(1+1i)
```

========================================================
<h3>Data types -- continued </h3>

* and non-numeric types:

 * logical 

```{r}
typeof(TRUE)
```

 
 * character

```{r}
typeof('banana')
```

* Understanding data types and the way they are coerced is important because R strictly enforces that data in a vector is of a single type.

* By keeping everything in a column the same, we can make simple assumptions about our data; 

  * if you can interpret one entry in the column as a number, then you can interpret all of them as numbers, so we donâ€™t have to check every time. 
  
* This consistency is what people mean when they talk about clean data; 

  * in the long run, strict consistency goes a long way to making our lives easier in R.



========================================================
<h3>Type coercion -- continued</h3>

<ul>
  <li> The coercion rules go: </li>
  <ol>
    <li> logical -> integer</li> 
    <li> integer -> numeric </li>
    <li> numeric -> complex </li>
    <li> complex -> character,</li>
  </ol>
  <li> where -> can be read as are transformed into.</li> 
  <li>You can try to force coercion against this flow using the as. functions, e.g.,</li>
</ul>

```{r}
as.numeric(c('1', '2', '3'))
```  



========================================================
<h2>Data structures</h2>

* Vectors are one type of data structure that we encounter frequently;

  * however, there are other related (and important) data structures that we will need to manipulate.

* R has an extremely developed tool for handling tabular data, such as comma separated values.

  * in R, this tool is a "dataframe".

* We will explore the functionality of dataframes with some "cat" data in some simple examples:

```{r}
cats <- data.frame(coat = c("calico", "black", "tabby"), 
                    weight = c(2.1, 5.0, 3.2), 
                    likes_string = c(1, 0, 1))
```

* Notice that the arguments of the function "data.frame()" are three expressions associating a name with a vector.


========================================================
<h3>Dataframes</h3>

* Printing the variable "cats", we see what tabular data looks like in a dataframe:

```{r}
cats
```

* The assignment of the vectors to names in the arguments assigned the column names.

* Each column consists of <b>a vector of uniform data type</b>.

* If we want to extract a named column from a dataframe, this can be done with the "$" sign and the column name:

```{r}
cats$weight
```

* Each row, on the other hand, consists of multiple measurements (of different data types) corresponding to one specific case of the data set.


========================================================
<h3>Dataframes -- continued</h3>

* We might suppose that the scale used to measure the cats' weights was off by two kgs.

* In this case, we can re-assign values into the column weight as follows:

```{r}
cats$weight
cats$weight <- cats$weight + 2
```

* We can verify that the assignment went into the column for weight in "cats",

```{r}
cats
```

========================================================
<h2>Lists </h2>

* A data structure related to vectors are <b>lists</b>.

* Lists function as containers for heterogeneous data, allowing different types:

```{r}
list_example <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
list_example
```

========================================================
<h3>Lists -- continued </h3>

* In the last example no type coercion has taken place; 

```{r}
typeof(list_example[[1]])
typeof(list_example[[2]])
```

  * all of the original types have been respected, but because the data is allowed to be inhomogeneous we can't use vector operations on a list.
  
```{r error=TRUE}
list_example + 2
```

* Here we see an error message because the "+" operator only knows how to operate on numeric arguments, or ones that can be coerced into one.

========================================================
<h3>Lists -- continued </h3>

* Recall our dataframe cats,

```{r}
cats
```

* We know that dataframes contain homogeneous data in each <b>column</b>, but each row may be inhomogeneous.

* <b>Q:</b>What kind of data structure do you think a dataframe is? Can it be a vector? Why or why not?

* <b>A:</b> A dataframe cannot be a vector because of coercion rules --- instead it operates as a <b>list of vectors</b>:

```{r}
typeof(cats)
typeof(cats$weight)
```

========================================================
<h2>Factors</h2>

* Consider now the vector "coat" in the dataframe:

```{r}
cats$coat
typeof(cats$coat)
as.numeric(cats$coat)
```

* <b>Q:</b> can you hypothesize what the meaning is of this data? What is a level, and why are the coats "integer"?

* <b>A:</b> R likes to treat character strings in dataframes as categorical variables;

  * in this case, the categories are "black", "calico" and "tabby";
  
  * each integer value is encoding whether the case (or row) belongs to category 1, 2 or 3, where category labels are sorted alphanumerically.

========================================================
<h2>Manipulating dataframes</h2>

* Let's suppose that we need to include more information on our cats in our analysis; 
  
  * a friend has provided ages of all the cats for us:

```{r}
age <- c(2, 3, 5)
```

* We want to combine this into our dataframe, which can be done with "cbind()"

```{r}
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
cats
```

* This function introduces the new vector as an additional column in the dataframe; 

 * the variable name is defined the column name, and we reassign the dataframe to cats recursively.

========================================================
<h3>Adding columns to dataframes</h3>


* <b>Q:</b> can you hypothesize what will be the output if we try to combine the following vector with the dataframe?

```{r eval=FALSE}
age <- c(2, 3, 5, 8, 9)
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
```

* <b>A:</b> dataframes, like matrices, need to have consistent dimensions of the data;

  * this new column is too long, so we will get an error:

```{r error=TRUE}
age <- c(2, 3, 5, 8, 9)
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
```

========================================================
<h3>Dataframe dimensions</h3>

* We can examine the dimensions of a dataframe with standard functions:

```{r}
dim(cats)
```

* In the above we see the standard, matrix style dimensions of the dataframe.

  * these can also be extracted individually with "nrow" and "ncol":

```{r}
nrow(cats)
ncol(cats)
```

========================================================
<h3>Dataframe indices</h3>

* Entries of dataframes can be accessed directly using matrix indexing:

```{r}
cats[2,4]
```

* This can also be performed with slices:
```{r}
cats[1:2, 2:3]
```

========================================================
<h3>Dataframe indices</h3>

* Additionally, we can use specialized notation for accessing an entire row or column:

```{r}
cats[,1]
cats[1,]
```

* Here, the blank in the place of the index tells R to extract the entire row or column.

========================================================
<h3>Adding rows to dataframes</h3>

* Let's suppose we have examined a new cat and we want to add a case to our dataframe:

```{r}
newRow <- list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9)
cats <- rbind(cats, newRow)
cats
```

* Notice, the "NA" value in the above for the coat of the fourth cat.

  * While the row was added successfully, it produces a "Not Available", missing data entry.
  
* Factors, like other vectors, are strict in R;

  * when we attempt to add a value that is not recognized as one of the categories, R treats this as missing data.


========================================================
<h3>Adding levels to factors</h3>

* We can access the levels of a factor vector with the "levels()" function:

```{r}
levels(cats$coat)
```

* If we want to re-assign new levels to a factor, we can do so recursively

```{r}
levels(cats$coat) <- c(levels(cats$coat), "tortoiseshell")
cats <- rbind(cats, list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9))
cats
```

* Notice, "tortiseshell" was now accepted as a category, but the NA value remains.

========================================================
<h3>Summarizing dataframes</h3>

* In general, we want to know if a dataframe has missing values, and what kind of variables are in it.

* Several common functions allow this, including

  * "str()" or the structure function:

```{r}
str(cats)
```

* This tells us what the dimensions are, the column names are, and what types of variables we are working with.

========================================================
<h3>Summarizing dataframes -- continued</h3>

* We can also obtain a quick statistical summary of the data with the "summary()" function:

```{r}
summary(cats)
```

* The summary furthermore tells us how many missing values are present.

========================================================
<h3>Removing rows</h3>

* We will often want to remove cases with missing data;

  * this can be performed automatically with "na.omit()"
  
```{r}
na.omit(cats)
```

========================================================
<h3>Removing rows or columns</h3>

* We can also remove rows or columns by index, using a "-"

```{r}
cats[-1,]
cats[,-1]
```


========================================================
<h2>File IO</h2>

* Basic file input/ output (IO) can be done with functions such as:

```{r}
write.csv(x = cats, file = "feline-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
cats_from_file <- read.csv(file = "feline-data.csv")
cats_from_file
```

* In the above, we wrote the data cats to the file "feline-data.csv" in the data directory;

* CSV is a file type that R knows how to read automatically into a dataframe with the "read.csv()" function;
  
  * using the above command, we read the file into a new dataframe "cats_from_file".

========================================================
<h3>File IO -- continued</h3>

* We will suppose that we wish to analyze a new set of cat data that a friend gave us:

```
coat,   weight,     likes_string
calico, 2.1,        1
black,  5.0,        0
tabby,  3.2,        1
tabby,  2.3 or 2.4, 1
```

* Our friend was uncertain about the weight of the last cat and placed two values into the CSV.

* We suppose that this is written in the file "feline-data_v2.csv" which we will read with "read.csv()",

```{r}
cats_from_file <- read.csv(file="feline-data_v2.csv")
cats_from_file$weight
```

* Notice that weight looks much different than before...

========================================================
<h3>Factors -- continued</h3>

* When R read the inhomogeneous data in the weights column, it first converted the values into character type;

  * when the character vector was seen by R in a dataframe, it then converted it automatically to a factor vector.
  
* Converting characters to factors automatically can be suppressed with additional arguments:

```{r}
cats_from_file <- read.csv(file="feline-data_v2.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
cats_from_file$weight
```

* However, this illustrates in general how erroneously entered data can cause many issues with type conversions.
