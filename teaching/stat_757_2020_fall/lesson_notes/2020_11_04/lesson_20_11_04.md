<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:
  * Power transformations and the Box-Cox method
  * Shifted log transformations
  * Logit and Fisher-z transformations
  * Polynomial regression

========================================================


<h2>General considerations for the change of scale of the response</h2>

* We have so far introduced some basic notions of how scale transformations of the response can be used to handle:

  * non-constant variance in the variation of the response around the mean response; and
  * non-Gaussian error distributions.
  
* Typically, we have referred to power transformations, i.e.,
  
  $$Y \mapsto Y^\lambda$$
  
  for some $\lambda \in (0,1)$; or
  
* log transformations where we have,

  $$Y \mapsto \log(Y)$$
  
  and an associated multiplicative form for the regression in the original scale,
  
  $$Y = \mathrm{exp}\{\mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}\}.$$
  
* Note that both of the above only make sense for non-negative (and for log, strictly positive) observations of the response variable.
  
* We will now introduce a systematic method for selecting such a transformation.
  

========================================================

<h2> Box-Cox Transformation</h2>

* The goal will be to find an "optimal" transformation problem with respect to some general form.

* The Box-Cox transformation is one particular way to perform this, which is defined only for positive data.

* We will suppose that there is some good form for the response that will solve issues around:
  1. non-constant variances of errors; and/or
  2. non-Gaussian errors;
  
 if we can find an appropriate parameter to do so.
 
* Our hypothesis function will be of the form,

  $$\begin{align}
  h_\lambda (Y)& = 
  \begin{cases}
  \Large{\frac{Y^\lambda -1}{\lambda} }& \text{if }\lambda \neq 0 \\ \\
  \log(Y) & \text{if } \lambda = 0
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}$$
  
  * the above transformation allows for both the possibility of a log transform or a square-root transform, albeit one with a transformation of location and slight re-scaling.
  
  * This is designed so that the function $h_\lambda$ converges to $\log$ when $\lambda \rightarrow 0$.

========================================================
### Box-Cox Transformation

* For any fixed value of $Y$ greater than zero, the function $h_\lambda$ is also continuous in the parameter value $\lambda$.

* In particular, we can try to maximize the likelihood of the known data (observations of $Y$) given all choices of $\lambda$;

* The log-likelihood function is given as,

  $$\begin{align}
  L(\lambda)& = -\frac{n}{2} \log\left(\frac{RSS_\lambda}{ n} \right) + \left( \lambda -1\right) \sum_{i=1}^n \log(Y_i)
  \end{align}$$
 
* Recall, because log is a monotonic function, maximizing the likelihood function is the same as maximizing the log-likelihood function --- we typically just use the log form for computational reasons. 
  
* The above function can be understood in several different competing parts:
  <ol>
    <li> The $RSS_\lambda$ is the residual sum of squares for the model when the response is given by $h_\lambda(Y)$ (the transformed variables). </li>
    <ul>
      <li> For small values of $RSS_\lambda$ normalized by $n$, the log will be negative, and therefor the term will become positive.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The terms $(\lambda - 1)\sum_{i}^n \mathrm{log}(Y_i)$ will favor small $\lambda \leq 1$ when many of the observations are small and positive, while these will favor $\lambda\geq 1$ when many of the observations are large.</li>
  </ol>

* Using R, we can compute the maximizing value $\hat{\lambda}$ to decide on the best change of variables that is possible within this family of transformations.


========================================================

### Box-Cox Transformation

* We note however, that to interpret, we will typically reduce this to $Y^{[\lambda]}$ for $\lambda\neq 0$ where $[\lambda]$ will be a value rounded to something close by and sensible to interpret.

* Particularly, in order to interpret this transformation, we should consider a confidence interval for $\lambda$.

* For an optimally chosen $\hat{\lambda}$, the $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval is given as

  $$\begin{align}
  \left\{ \lambda :L(\lambda)  > L\left(\hat{\lambda}\right) - \frac{1}{2}{\chi_1^2}^{\left(1-\alpha\right)} \right\}
  \end{align}$$
 
 where 
 
   * $L$ is the same log-likelihood function as before;
   * ${\chi_1^2}^{(1-\alpha)}$ is the Chi-squared distribution critical value corresponding to the $\alpha$ critical value.
   
* The confidence interval thus gives some sense of what values are plausible to round to in the exponent of the response variable.
   
========================================================

<h3>An example of the Box-Cox transformation</h3>

* In R, the fitting of the appropriate value of $\hat{\lambda}$ can be performed simply using the `boxcox` function from the `MASS` library.

* This is demonstrated on the savings data -- the horizontal axis will be the value of the parameter $\lambda$ while the vertical axis will be the log-likelihood:


```r
library("MASS")
library("faraway")
par(cex=3, mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
boxcox(lm(sr ~ pop15+pop75+dpi+ddpi,savings), plotit=T, lambda=seq(0.5,1.5,by=0.1))
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](lesson_20_11_04-figure/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

* In the last transformation, the confidence interval was wide, containing values both greater and less than one, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis, $Y\mapsto Y$.

  * Particularly, these have very different interpretations for the exponent, and we should not make any power transformation in this case.
  

========================================================

<h3>An example of the Box-Cox transformation</h3>

*  We can try a transformation instead on the Galapagos data,


```r
lmod <- lm(Species ~ Area + Elevation + Nearest + Scruz +Adjacent,gala)
par(cex=3, mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
boxcox(lmod, lambda=seq(-0.25,0.75,by=0.05),plotit=T)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](lesson_20_11_04-figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

* <b>Q:</b>  in this case do we reject the null hypothesis (i.e., reject the hypothesis that no transformation is necessary)?


* <b>A:</b> in this case, we exclude the null hypothesis, and we can see that there is a reasonable choice of a cubic root transformation for the number of species.

  * A square root transformation is also just barely within our confidence interval, making this also a plausible choice.

========================================================

<h3> General considerations about Box-Cox transformations</h3>

<ol> 
  <li>Box-Cox transformations are sensitive to outliers, and high values of $\hat{\lambda}$ should be suspect.</li>
  <li>If some $Y_i$ <0, we can make the values positive by translating the data by a small constant --- this should be applied to all values.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>However, this is bit "hacky" and reduces the interpretability.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the overall spread of the data,
  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{\text{max}_i Y_i}{\text{min}_i Y_i}  
  \end{align}$$
  is not too large, transformation by powers has little effect on the overall regression. </li> 
  <ul>
    <li> For small enough range, polynomials can be well approximated by linear scales and therefore we don't expect much change if the relative scale is small.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>It is debatable if $\lambda$ should be considered a parameter in the number of degrees of freedom (and therefore in the measure of overfitting).</li> 
  <ul>
    <li>In general, we should only apply a transformation of scale when it is deemed absolutely necessary.</li>
    <li>We typically lose interpretability of the regression when we make transformations, and we should always transfer inferences back to the relevant scale of interest for the users.</li>
    <li>In doing so, we should qualify these results and determine if the scale has introduced "unphyiscal" interpretations of the paramters, predictions, etc...</li>
    <li>Of course, after making any such transformation we should re-run diagnostics to determin if this has had the intended effect.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

========================================================

## Shifted-log transformations

* A similar family of transformations can be defined by a shifted log, i.e.,

  $$\begin{align}
  g_\alpha(Y) = \log\left(Y + \alpha\right)
  \end{align}$$

  * This again should be used for positive data but may be used in a "hacky" way with non-positive data.
  
* We will consider using this transformation on observations of the burning time of tobacco leaves, in the dataset "leafburn"


```r
head(leafburn)
```

```
  nitrogen chlorine potassium burntime
1     3.05     1.45      5.67      2.2
2     4.22     1.35      4.86      1.3
3     3.34     0.26      4.19      2.4
4     3.77     0.23      4.42      4.8
5     3.52     1.10      3.17      1.5
6     3.54     0.76      2.76      1.0
```

* Here the burn time is the response, while the leaves have various chemical charateristics that we want to regress on the response with.

* We will use the "logtrans" function also in the "MASS" library to perform a similar maximium likelihood optimization for the choice of $\alpha$ versus the data.

========================================================
  
### Shifted-log transformations  


```r
lmod <- lm(burntime ~ nitrogen+chlorine+potassium, leafburn)
par(cex=3, mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
logtrans(lmod, plotit=TRUE, alpha=seq(-min(leafburn$burntime) +0.001,0,by=0.01))
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](lesson_20_11_04-figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

* <b>Q:</b> is a (non-shifted) log transformation justified based on this confidence interval?

* <b>A:</b> The optimization procedure indicates that a log transformation of the response by itself isn't reasonable, as evidenced by excluding zero.

* However, it suggests that a negative shift by the parameter will make a log transformation reasonable.

* Physically, this may be interpreted as a lag-period before the burn can begin the log-scale combustion period.

========================================================

<h3> Additional transformations</h3>

* In special cases when we are looking at a response variable that is a percentage, we are already looking at a particular scale $Y\in [0,1]$.

* In these cases, we may also consider using a logit transformation of the response,

  $$\begin{align}
  \log\left(\frac{Y}{1 - Y}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  
  * this has the effect of moving the range of the response between $-\infty$ and $\infty$, which may help the issues of non-constant variances and non-Gaussianity.
  
* Logit and the inverse logit transformations are included in the `faraway` package as `logit` and `ilogit` respectively. 
  
* Fisher's z-transformation may also be worth considering,

  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{2} \log\left(\frac{1+Y}{1-Y}\right),
  \end{align}$$
  which has the range $[0, \infty]$.
  
* In both cases above, we must take care to interpret the response (again) by transforming it back into the normal percentage values.

========================================================

<h2> Polynomial regression</h2>

* One way to increase the flexibility of our models is to include polynomial terms of the explanatory variables in the model.

* In the case of a simple regression,

  $$\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon,
  \end{align}$$
  
* We can increase the flexibility of the model by extending this relationship to

  $$\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \cdots + \beta_d X^d + \epsilon.
  \end{align}$$
  
* We note that when doing so, this is qualitatively <b>different</b> than writing the model as,

  $$\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X^2 + \epsilon
  \end{align}$$
  
  which is equivalent to a change of scale for the explanatory variable.
  
* The choice of a polynomial regression is still a linear model, as the signal is linear in the estimated parameters.

  * However, the the interpretation differs when using a polynomial regression versus a change of scale.

========================================================
### Polynomial regression

* We usually do not believe the polynomial exactly represents any underlying reality, but it can allow us to model expected features of the relationship. 

  * This differs from a scale change in which there may be some transformation of scale that will rectify issues with the assumptions of the Gauss-Markov theorem.

* In the case of polynomial regression, we introduce additional flexibility in terms of resembling the signal in the original scale.

  * For instance,  a quadratic term allows for a predictor to have an optimal setting -- there may be a best temperature for baking bread, and we wish to model this relationship with the ability to find an optimal setting. 

  * Particularly, a hotter or colder temperature may result in a lower quality product. 
* If you believe a predictor behaves in this manner, it makes sense to add a quadratic term.

* However, we should be cognizant of how much flexibility we introduce into the relationship, to prevent overfitting.

========================================================

### Selecting the degree of the polynomial  

* Because the degree of the polynomial $d$ could be of arbitrary size, we should try to make the selection systematically.
  
* Firstly, we should not have a degree of polynomial even close to the number of observations --- this will generally lead to severe overfitting.
  
* Typically, we will then choose the degree by evaluating the number of parameters one at a time by their significance.

* If we start with a linear model ($d=1$) we can add higher order terms one at a time, stopping at the last $d$ for which the parameter $\beta_d$ is still significant.

========================================================

### Selecting the degree of the polynomial  


* If we start with a model of degree $d\geq2$, with some known nonlinear structure in mind, we can remove higher order terms.

* However, we should <b>always start with removing the highest term</b> whenever <b>any parameter is not significant</b>.

* Generally, the p-values for different degrees of polynomial terms will change in the presence / absence of other higher order terms.

  * With reduction of complexity in mind, we want to find the degree as low as possible in which all terms have significance.
  
* Supposed we have a cubic model of the form,

 $$\begin{align}
 Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \beta_3 X^3  + \epsilon
 \end{align}$$
 in which  $\beta_3$ and$\beta_1$ are significant, while $\beta_2$ is not significant.
 
* If we remove the $X^2$ term,

 $$\begin{align}
 Y = \beta_0  + \beta_1 X + \beta_3 X^3 + \epsilon
 \end{align}$$
 we have an issue in terms of non-uniqueness in the form of the signal.
 
* Particularly, consider the alternative model in which we regress upon the anomalies of the predictor from its mean,

 $$\begin{align}
 Y = \beta_0  + \beta_1 (X - \overline{X}) + \beta_3 (X - \overline{X})^3 + \epsilon
 \end{align}$$
 we can see that in the expansion of terms, we re-introduce quadratic terms to the model.
 
* For this reason, we should respect the hierarchy of terms, and remove higher order terms first.


========================================================

### Selecting the degree of the polynomial  

* We will show the forward process with the savings data.



```r
sumary(lm(sr ~ ddpi,savings))
```

```
            Estimate Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)  7.88302    1.01100  7.7972 4.465e-10
ddpi         0.47583    0.21462  2.2171   0.03139

n = 50, p = 2, Residual SE = 4.31145, R-Squared = 0.09
```

* As a simple regression, we see that the "ddpi" is significant as a linear term for the savings rate.


```r
sumary(lm(sr ~  ddpi+I(ddpi^2),savings))

n = 50, p = 3, Residual SE = 4.07902, R-Squared = 0.2
```

* Similarly for quadratic terms....

========================================================

### Selecting the degree of the polynomial

F-statistic: 3.953 on 3 and 46 DF,  p-value: 0.01369
```

* However, the cubic term is the first term that is (incrementally) not significant; 

  * therefore, we select a maximal degree equal to $d=2$.

* Note that starting from quartic and moving downward through cubic would have given the same result.

========================================================

### Orthogonal polynomials 

* In general, fitting this repeatedly "by hand" is difficult, and numerically unstable.

* A special class of polynomials that are "orthogonal" can be used to perform this polynomial regression analysis at once, and in a stable way.

* These polynomials exist up to arbitrary degree, with specially selected coefficients,

 $$\begin{align}
 Z_1 =& a_1 + b_1X \\
 Z_2 =& a_2 + b_2 X + c_2 X^2\\
 Z_3 =& a_3 + b_3 X + c_3 X^2 + d_3 X^3\\
 \vdots &
 \end{align}$$
 such that as vectors  $\mathbf{Z}_i^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{Z}_j = 0$ when $i\neq j$.

* Particularly, we recall that if the predictors are orthogonal, we eliminate correlations between the variables.

  * This has the advantage of making the values of the parameters $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_d$ independent of the choice of the other variables.
  
* Therefore, we can evaluate the p-values of all parameters for arbitrary degree polynomials simultaneously.

  * The cost, however, is that the meaning of the predictors becomes far less interpretable.



========================================================

### Orthogonal polynomials


* The R function "poly" will compute the orthogonal polynomials to a specified degree, and this can be used for an effcient analysis,


```r
lmod <- lm(sr ~ poly(ddpi,4),savings)
sumary(lmod)
```

```
                 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)      9.671000   0.584602 16.5429  < 2e-16
poly(ddpi, 4)1   9.558993   4.133760  2.3124  0.02539
poly(ddpi, 4)2 -10.499876   4.133760 -2.5400  0.01461
poly(ddpi, 4)3  -0.037374   4.133760 -0.0090  0.99283
poly(ddpi, 4)4   3.611968   4.133760  0.8738  0.38688

n = 50, p = 5, Residual SE = 4.13376, R-Squared = 0.22
```



========================================================

### Orthogonal polynomials

* Comparing with the earlier model, the regression in terms of up-to-cubic orthogonal polynomials has approximately the same p-values and estimated parameters:


```r
sumary(lm(sr ~ poly(ddpi,3),savings))
```

```
                 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)      9.671000   0.583097 16.5856  < 2e-16
poly(ddpi, 3)1   9.558993   4.123119  2.3184  0.02493
poly(ddpi, 3)2 -10.499876   4.123119 -2.5466  0.01429
poly(ddpi, 3)3  -0.037374   4.123119 -0.0091  0.99281

n = 50, p = 4, Residual SE = 4.12312, R-Squared = 0.2
```

* Likewise, for the model in to up-to-quadratic terms:


```r
sumary(lm(sr ~ poly(ddpi,2),savings))
```

```
                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)      9.67100    0.57686 16.7649  < 2e-16
poly(ddpi, 2)1   9.55899    4.07902  2.3435  0.02339
poly(ddpi, 2)2 -10.49988    4.07902 -2.5741  0.01326

n = 50, p = 3, Residual SE = 4.07902, R-Squared = 0.2
```


========================================================

## Multinomial regression

* The methods of polynomial regression will extend to multinomials in different variables.

* That is to say, we can write the response as a function,
 $$\begin{align}
 Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_{11} X_1^2 + \beta_{22}X_2^2 + \beta_{12} X_1 X_2 
 \end{align}$$

* In R, this type of model can be implemented using the `polym` function as follows:


```r
lmod <- lm(sr ~ polym(pop15,ddpi,degree=2),savings)
```

* In two predictors, we can construct a surface plot for the response in the two variables.


```r
pop15r <- seq(20, 50, len=10)
ddpir <- seq(0, 20, len=10)
pgrid <- expand.grid(pop15=pop15r, ddpi=ddpir)
pv <- predict(lmod, pgrid)
persp(pop15r, ddpir, matrix(pv, 10, 10), theta=45, xlab="Pop under 15", ylab="Growth", zlab = "Savings rate", ticktype="detailed", shade = 0.25)
```

* This determines the range of values to be plotted on a $10 \times 10$ grid over the range of the predictors.

* We show this plot on the next slide...

* Here, the powers in the two variables are listed in the format $a.b$ such that the significance of the parameter for the term $X_1^a X_2^b$, denoted $\beta_{ab}$, can be evaluated.

* In this case, we can see that the higher order terms (combined degree two or greater) lack significance and that we'd be better off to simplify the model into a linear regression on the two different variables.

## A reivew of transformations

* With the Box-Cox transformation,

  $$\begin{align}
  h_\lambda (Y)& = 
  \begin{cases}
  \Large{\frac{Y^\lambda -1}{\lambda} }& \text{if }\lambda \neq 0 \\
  \log(Y) & \text{if } \lambda = 0
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}$$

 we have a way to systematically search for an "optimal" power transformation (or possibly log transformation) of the response when the <b>response is positive</b>.
 
*  Using a maximum likelihood approach, this finds the value $\lambda$ that best transforms the response above.

* We note, however, the actual value of $\lambda$ should be chosen by the confidence interval;

  * it is best to round $\lambda$ to a value that is easier to interpret, e.g., square root, cubic root, etc...

* We should also evaluate different reasonable values for the transformation based on the confidence interval.

### A reivew of transformations

<ol> 
  <li>Box-Cox transformations are sensitive to outliers, and high values of $\hat{\lambda}$ should be suspect.</li>
  <li>If some $Y_i$ <0, we can make the values positive by translating the data by a small constant --- this should be applied to all values.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>However, this is bit "hacky" and reduces the interpretability.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the overall spread of the data,
  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{\text{max}_i Y_i}{\text{min}_i Y_i}  
  \end{align}$$
  is not too large, transformation by powers has little effect on the overall regression. </li> 
  <ul>
    <li> For small enough range, polynomials can be well approximated by linear scales and therefore we don't expect much change if the relative scale is small.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>It is debatable if $\lambda$ should be considered a parameter in the number of degrees of freedom (and therefore in the measure of overfitting).</li> 
  <ul>
    <li>In general, we should only apply a transformation of scale when it is deemed absolutely necessary.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

### A reivew of transformations

* In some special cases, we may also consider a shifted log transformation, in which we want to account for some kind of delay in the response, in log scale.

* For data on a small bounded interval, e.g., percentages, it can also make sense to try a logit transformation of the response,

  $$\begin{align}
  \log\left(\frac{Y}{1 - Y}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  
  * this has the effect of moving the range of the response between $-\infty$ and $\infty$, which may help the issues of non-constant variances and non-Gaussianity.
  
* Fisher's z-transformation may also be worth considering,

  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{2} \log\left(\frac{1+Y}{1-Y}\right),
  \end{align}$$
  which has the range $[0, \infty]$.
  
* In both cases above, we must take care to interpret the response (again) by transforming it back into the normal percentage values.


========================================================

### A reivew polynomial regression

* Polynomial regression is qualitatively different that changing the scale of the predictor $X$.

* We can increase the flexibility of the model by extending a relationship to

  $$\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \cdots + \beta_d X^d + \epsilon.
  \end{align}$$
  
* We note that when doing so, this is qualitatively <b>different</b> than writing the model as,

  $$\begin{align}
  Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X^2 + \epsilon
  \end{align}$$
  
  which is equivalent to a change of scale for the explanatory variable.
  
* The choice of a polynomial regression is still a linear model, as the signal is linear in the estimated parameters.

  * However, the the interpretation differs when using a polynomial regression versus a change of scale.


========================================================

### A reivew polynomial regression

* In particular for polynomial regression, it is better to remove higher degree terms rather than lower degree terms when a term lacks significance.

* We can choose to use orthogonal polynomials to evaluate arbitrary degrees of uncorrelated polynomial terms.

  * This can be used to obtain more stability of the result, but it comes with the cost that the meaning of the orthogonal polynomial predictors are harder to interpret.
  
* Multinomial regression is a simple extension of this, but we note, when any of the highest degree $d$ mixed or univariate terms do not have significance, we should remove all terms of degree $d$.
