<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:

 * Vectorization
 * Variables and data types
 * Dataframes
 * Factors
 * File I/O
 * Basic plotting

* These lectures are based on the materials in [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).

========================================================


<h2> Vectorization</h2>

* R is a vectorized language, meaning that variables and functions can have vectors as values. 

* A vector in R describes a set of values in a certain order of the <b>same data type</b>.

  * The type of data will become increasingly important as we start using vectors.
  
* A simple way to construct a vector is with the constructor function "c()"


```r
c(1, 3, 6)
```

```
[1] 1 3 6
```

========================================================

<h3> Vectorization -- continued</h3>


* The function takes an arbitrary number of elements as above, and creates a vector.


```r
my_variable <- c(TRUE, pi)
my_variable
```

```
[1] 1.000000 3.141593
```

* Notice that the output of the above expression looks different from the input --- this is because R forces vectors to have data of a single type:


```r
typeof(my_variable)
```

```
[1] "double"
```

* Here, the value "TRUE" has been forced into its numeric counterpart "1".

========================================================

<h3> Vectorization -- continued</h3>

* Certain functions allow us to construct vectors automatically based on a range of values, known as a "slice"


```r
my_variable <- 1:5
my_variable
```

```
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

* We can make a general slice where the arguments are given as a:b and returns a vector of all integer spaced values between a and b:


```r
10:5
```

```
[1] 10  9  8  7  6  5
```

```r
4:10
```

```
[1]  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

* This is often quite useful for extracting a subset of data from a large vector or matrix.

========================================================

<h3> Vectorization -- continued</h3>

* One additional useful construction function for vectors is the "seq()" or sequence generation function.

* This is like the slice operator ":", but with the additional argument "by"


```r
seq(1,10, by=0.1)
```

```
 [1]  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6  1.7  1.8  1.9  2.0  2.1  2.2  2.3
[15]  2.4  2.5  2.6  2.7  2.8  2.9  3.0  3.1  3.2  3.3  3.4  3.5  3.6  3.7
[29]  3.8  3.9  4.0  4.1  4.2  4.3  4.4  4.5  4.6  4.7  4.8  4.9  5.0  5.1
[43]  5.2  5.3  5.4  5.5  5.6  5.7  5.8  5.9  6.0  6.1  6.2  6.3  6.4  6.5
[57]  6.6  6.7  6.8  6.9  7.0  7.1  7.2  7.3  7.4  7.5  7.6  7.7  7.8  7.9
[71]  8.0  8.1  8.2  8.3  8.4  8.5  8.6  8.7  8.8  8.9  9.0  9.1  9.2  9.3
[85]  9.4  9.5  9.6  9.7  9.8  9.9 10.0
```

* Using this, we can create a vector with a range of values with an arbitrary step in between.


========================================================

<h3> Vectorization -- continued</h3>

* Using vectors will often be necessary, but it is also extremely useful to perform mathematical operations in vectors as above.

  * Vectors firstly make code more compact and easier to read for someone working on it.
  
  * Moreover, vector operations are typically faster than alternative methods of computing.
  
  * This is because the underlying "machinery" in R is faster than executing R code;
    
    * in particular, operations as above and mathematical functions have been optimized for performance.
  
* Most typically, we will furthermore be examining tabular data which is expressed most commonly as a matrix.

* A loose familiarity with matrices will be necessary in this course, but not a deep understanding of linear algebra or applied matrix theory.

* Advanced students will benefit from understanding matrix factorizations such as QR and singular value decompositions, but the R language will take care of these details in practice.

========================================================
<h2> Review of the material </h2>

* <b>Q:</b> consider the following expressions.  What is the final value of "x" and the final value of "y"?


```r
x <- 5
y <- 3
x <- x * y
y <- y - x
```

* <b>A:</b>


```r
x
```

```
[1] 15
```

```r
y
```

```
[1] -12
```

========================================================
<h3> Review of the material -- continued </h3>

* <b>Q:</b> is the following expression guaranteed to be "TRUE"?


```r
0 == sin(pi)
```

* <b>A:</b> not necessarily, the way that numerical values are understood by the machine is not the same as they are mathematically:


```r
0 == sin(pi)
```

```
[1] FALSE
```

* <b>Q:</b> what is the outcome of the following comparison, and why?

```
1 == TRUE
```

* <b>A:</b> it is TRUE, because the logical has been coerced into numeric.


```r
1 == TRUE
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

========================================================
<h3> Review of the material -- continued </h3>


* <b>Q:</b> consider the following expressions --- what is the final output?


```r
x <- 9:25
y <- 3:4
x[y]
```

* <b>A:</b>


```r
x[y]
```

```
[1] 11 12
```


* <b>Q:</b> consider the following expressions --- what is the final output?


```r
x <- 9:25
y <- x > 16
x[y]
```

* <b>A:</b>


```r
x[y]
```

```
[1] 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
```

========================================================
<h3>Review of material -- continued</h3>

* We have seen that we can apply mathematical operations to numerical vectors. 

* <b>Q:</b> what do you expect the output to be of the following statement?


```r
c('red', 'blue', 'green') + 2
```

* <b>A:</b>


```r
my_vector <- c('red', 'blue', 'green') + 2
```

```
Error in c("red", "blue", "green") + 2: non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

* R was told to add together a numerical value and a character value, for which there is no defined output with addition.

* For operations that are undefined, there will usually be an error message as the output.

========================================================

<h2>Data types</h2>

* There are 5 main types in R: 

 * double;


```r
typeof(pi)
```

```
[1] "double"
```

 * integer;


```r
typeof(1L)
```

```
[1] "integer"
```
 
 * complex;


```r
typeof(1+1i)
```

```
[1] "complex"
```

========================================================
<h3>Data types -- continued </h3>

* and non-numeric types:

 * logical 


```r
typeof(TRUE)
```

```
[1] "logical"
```

 
 * character


```r
typeof('banana')
```

```
[1] "character"
```

* Understanding data types and the way they are coerced is important because R strictly enforces that data in a vector is of a single type.

* By keeping everything in a column the same, we can make simple assumptions about our data; 

  * if you can interpret one entry in the column as a number, then you can interpret all of them as numbers, so we donâ€™t have to check every time. 
  
* This consistency is what people mean when they talk about clean data; 

  * in the long run, strict consistency goes a long way to making our lives easier in R.


========================================================
<h2>Type coercion</h2>

* We have seen how a vector may coerce a logical value to numeric one:


```r
c(TRUE, pi)
```

```
[1] 1.000000 3.141593
```

* <b>Q:</b> what do you expect the output of the following expression to be?


```r
c(TRUE, 'TRUE')
```

* <b>A:</b> in this case, the logical is coerced into a "character" string,


```r
c(TRUE, 'TRUE')
```

```
[1] "TRUE" "TRUE"
```

========================================================
<h3>Type coercion -- continued</h3>

<ul>
  <li> The coercion rules go: </li>
  <ol>
    <li> logical -> integer</li> 
    <li> integer -> numeric </li>
    <li> numeric -> complex </li>
    <li> complex -> character,</li>
  </ol>
  <li> where -> can be read as are transformed into.</li> 
  <li>You can try to force coercion against this flow using the as. functions, e.g.,</li>
</ul>


```r
as.numeric(c('1', '2', '3'))
```

```
[1] 1 2 3
```



========================================================
<h2>Data structures</h2>

* Vectors are one type of data structure that we encounter frequently;

  * however, there are other related (and important) data structures that we will need to manipulate.

* R has an extremely developed tool for handling tabular data, such as comma separated values.

  * in R, this tool is a "dataframe".

* We will explore the functionality of dataframes with some "cat" data in some simple examples:


```r
cats <- data.frame(coat = c("calico", "black", "tabby"), 
                    weight = c(2.1, 5.0, 3.2), 
                    likes_string = c(1, 0, 1))
```

* Notice that the arguments of the function "data.frame()" are three expressions associating a name with a vector.


========================================================
<h3>Dataframes</h3>

* Printing the variable "cats", we see what tabular data looks like in a dataframe:


```r
cats
```

```
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    2.1            1
2  black    5.0            0
3  tabby    3.2            1
```

* The assignment of the vectors to names in the arguments assigned the column names.

* Each column consists of <b>a vector of uniform data type</b>.

* If we want to extract a named column from a dataframe, this can be done with the "$" sign and the column name:


```r
cats$weight
```

```
[1] 2.1 5.0 3.2
```

* Each row, on the other hand, consists of multiple measurements (of different data types) corresponding to one specific case of the data set.


========================================================
<h3>Dataframes -- continued</h3>

* We might suppose that the scale used to measure the cats' weights was off by two kgs.

* In this case, we can re-assign values into the column weight as follows:


```r
cats$weight
```

```
[1] 2.1 5.0 3.2
```

```r
cats$weight <- cats$weight + 2
```

* We can verify that the assignment went into the column for weight in "cats",


```r
cats
```

```
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    4.1            1
2  black    7.0            0
3  tabby    5.2            1
```

========================================================
<h2>Lists </h2>

* A data structure related to vectors are <b>lists</b>.

* Lists function as containers for heterogeneous data, allowing different types:


```r
list_example <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
list_example
```

```
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] "a"

[[3]]
[1] TRUE

[[4]]
[1] 1+4i
```

========================================================
<h3>Lists -- continued </h3>

* In the last example no type coercion has taken place; 


```r
typeof(list_example[[1]])
```

```
[1] "double"
```

```r
typeof(list_example[[2]])
```

```
[1] "character"
```

  * all of the original types have been respected, but because the data is allowed to be inhomogeneous we can't use vector operations on a list.
  

```r
list_example + 2
```

```
Error in list_example + 2: non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

* Here we see an error message because the "+" operator only knows how to operate on numeric arguments, or ones that can be coerced into one.

========================================================
<h3>Lists -- continued </h3>

* Recall our dataframe cats,


```r
cats
```

```
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    4.1            1
2  black    7.0            0
3  tabby    5.2            1
```

* We know that dataframes contain homogeneous data in each <b>column</b>, but each row may be inhomogeneous.

* <b>Q:</b>What kind of data structure do you think a dataframe is? Can it be a vector? Why or why not?

* <b>A:</b> A dataframe cannot be a vector because of coercion rules --- instead it operates as a <b>list of vectors</b>:


```r
typeof(cats)
```

```
[1] "list"
```

```r
typeof(cats$weight)
```

```
[1] "double"
```

========================================================
<h2>Factors</h2>

* Consider now the vector "coat" in the dataframe:


```r
cats$coat
```

```
[1] calico black  tabby 
Levels: black calico tabby
```

```r
typeof(cats$coat)
```

```
[1] "integer"
```

```r
as.numeric(cats$coat)
```

```
[1] 2 1 3
```

* <b>Q:</b> can you hypothesize what the meaning is of this data? What is a level, and why are the coats "integer"?

* <b>A:</b> R likes to treat character strings in dataframes as categorical variables;

  * in this case, the categories are "black", "calico" and "tabby";
  
  * each integer value is encoding whether the case (or row) belongs to category 1, 2 or 3, where category labels are sorted alphanumerically.

========================================================
<h2>Manipulating dataframes</h2>

* Let's suppose that we need to include more information on our cats in our analysis; 
  
  * a friend has provided ages of all the cats for us:


```r
age <- c(2, 3, 5)
```

* We want to combine this into our dataframe, which can be done with "cbind()"


```r
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
cats
```

```
    coat weight likes_string age
1 calico    4.1            1   2
2  black    7.0            0   3
3  tabby    5.2            1   5
```

* This function introduces the new vector as an additional column in the dataframe; 

 * the variable name is defined the column name, and we reassign the dataframe to cats recursively.

========================================================
<h3>Adding columns to dataframes</h3>


* <b>Q:</b> can you hypothesize what will be the output if we try to combine the following vector with the dataframe?


```r
age <- c(2, 3, 5, 8, 9)
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
```

* <b>A:</b> dataframes, like matrices, need to have consistent dimensions of the data;

  * this new column is too long, so we will get an error:


```r
age <- c(2, 3, 5, 8, 9)
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
```

```
Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE): arguments imply differing number of rows: 3, 5
```

========================================================
<h3>Dataframe dimensions</h3>

* We can examine the dimensions of a dataframe with standard functions:


```r
dim(cats)
```

```
[1] 3 4
```

* In the above we see the standard, matrix style dimensions of the dataframe.

  * these can also be extracted individually with "nrow" and "ncol":


```r
nrow(cats)
```

```
[1] 3
```

```r
ncol(cats)
```

```
[1] 4
```

========================================================
<h3>Dataframe indices</h3>

* Entries of dataframes can be accessed directly using matrix indexing:


```r
cats[2,4]
```

```
[1] 3
```

* This can also be performed with slices:

```r
cats[1:2, 2:3]
```

```
  weight likes_string
1    4.1            1
2    7.0            0
```

========================================================
<h3>Dataframe indices</h3>

* Additionally, we can use specialized notation for accessing an entire row or column:


```r
cats[,1]
```

```
[1] calico black  tabby 
Levels: black calico tabby
```

```r
cats[1,]
```

```
    coat weight likes_string age
1 calico    4.1            1   2
```

* Here, the blank in the place of the index tells R to extract the entire row or column.

========================================================
<h3>Adding rows to dataframes</h3>

* Let's suppose we have examined a new cat and we want to add a case to our dataframe:


```r
newRow <- list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9)
cats <- rbind(cats, newRow)
cats
```

```
    coat weight likes_string age
1 calico    4.1            1   2
2  black    7.0            0   3
3  tabby    5.2            1   5
4   <NA>    3.3            1   9
```

* Notice, the "NA" value in the above for the coat of the fourth cat.

  * While the row was added successfully, it produces a "Not Available", missing data entry.
  
* Factors, like other vectors, are strict in R;

  * when we attempt to add a value that is not recognized as one of the categories, R treats this as missing data.


========================================================
<h3>Adding levels to factors</h3>

* We can access the levels of a factor vector with the "levels()" function:


```r
levels(cats$coat)
```

```
[1] "black"  "calico" "tabby" 
```

* If we want to re-assign new levels to a factor, we can do so recursively


```r
levels(cats$coat) <- c(levels(cats$coat), "tortoiseshell")
cats <- rbind(cats, list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9))
cats
```

```
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    4.1            1   2
2         black    7.0            0   3
3         tabby    5.2            1   5
4          <NA>    3.3            1   9
5 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
```

* Notice, "tortiseshell" was now accepted as a category, but the NA value remains.

========================================================
<h3>Summarizing dataframes</h3>

* In general, we want to know if a dataframe has missing values, and what kind of variables are in it.

* Several common functions allow this, including

  * "str()" or the structure function:


```r
str(cats)
```

```
'data.frame':	5 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ coat        : Factor w/ 4 levels "black","calico",..: 2 1 3 NA 4
 $ weight      : num  4.1 7 5.2 3.3 3.3
 $ likes_string: num  1 0 1 1 1
 $ age         : num  2 3 5 9 9
```

* This tells us what the dimensions are, the column names are, and what types of variables we are working with.

========================================================
<h3>Summarizing dataframes -- continued</h3>

* We can also obtain a quick statistical summary of the data with the "summary()" function:


```r
summary(cats)
```

```
            coat       weight      likes_string      age     
 black        :1   Min.   :3.30   Min.   :0.0   Min.   :2.0  
 calico       :1   1st Qu.:3.30   1st Qu.:1.0   1st Qu.:3.0  
 tabby        :1   Median :4.10   Median :1.0   Median :5.0  
 tortoiseshell:1   Mean   :4.58   Mean   :0.8   Mean   :5.6  
 NA's         :1   3rd Qu.:5.20   3rd Qu.:1.0   3rd Qu.:9.0  
                   Max.   :7.00   Max.   :1.0   Max.   :9.0  
```

* The summary furthermore tells us how many missing values are present.

========================================================
<h3>Removing rows</h3>

* We will often want to remove cases with missing data;

  * this can be performed automatically with "na.omit()"
  

```r
na.omit(cats)
```

```
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    4.1            1   2
2         black    7.0            0   3
3         tabby    5.2            1   5
5 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
```

========================================================
<h3>Removing rows or columns</h3>

* We can also remove rows or columns by index, using a "-"


```r
cats[-1,]
```

```
           coat weight likes_string age
2         black    7.0            0   3
3         tabby    5.2            1   5
4          <NA>    3.3            1   9
5 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
```

```r
cats[,-1]
```

```
  weight likes_string age
1    4.1            1   2
2    7.0            0   3
3    5.2            1   5
4    3.3            1   9
5    3.3            1   9
```


========================================================
<h2>File IO</h2>

* Basic file input/ output (IO) can be done with functions such as:


```r
write.csv(x = cats, file = "data/feline-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
cats_from_file <- read.csv(file = "data/feline-data.csv")
cats_from_file
```

```
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    4.1            1   2
2         black    7.0            0   3
3         tabby    5.2            1   5
4          <NA>    3.3            1   9
5 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
```

* In the above, we wrote the data cats to the file "feline-data.csv" in the data directory;

* CSV is a file type that R knows how to read automatically into a dataframe with the "read.csv()" function;
  
  * using the above command, we read the file into a new dataframe "cats_from_file".

========================================================
<h3>File IO -- continued</h3>

* We will suppose that we wish to analyze a new set of cat data that a friend gave us:

```
coat,   weight,     likes_string
calico, 2.1,        1
black,  5.0,        0
tabby,  3.2,        1
tabby,  2.3 or 2.4, 1
```

* Our friend was uncertain about the weight of the last cat and placed two values into the CSV.

* We suppose that this is written in the file "feline-data_v2.csv" which we will read with "read.csv()",


```r
cats_from_file <- read.csv(file="data/feline-data_v2.csv")
cats_from_file$weight
```

```
[1] 2.1        5.0        3.2        2.3 or 2.4
Levels: 2.1 2.3 or 2.4 3.2 5.0
```

* Notice that weight looks much different than before...

========================================================
<h3>Factors -- continued</h3>

* When R read the inhomogeneous data in the weights column, it first converted the values into character type;

  * when the character vector was seen by R in a dataframe, it then converted it automatically to a factor vector.
  
* Converting characters to factors automatically can be suppressed with additional arguments:


```r
cats_from_file <- read.csv(file="data/feline-data_v2.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
cats_from_file$weight
```

```
[1] "2.1"        "5.0"        "3.2"        "2.3 or 2.4"
```

* However, this illustrates in general how erroneously entered data can cause many issues with type conversions.

<h2>A realistic dataframe</h2>

* Through much of the class, we will call data from different libraries in R.

* For this lesson, and the homework, we will consider the ``gapminder`` data.

  * We start by importing this from R:
  

```r
require(gapminder)
```

* When we start looking at new data, best practice is to start interrogating it to see the data types, the number of cases and the different variables in each case:


```r
str(gapminder)
```

```
Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':	1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ pop      : int  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 14880372 12881816 13867957 16317921 22227415 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...
```

========================================================
<h3>A realistic dataframe -- continued</h3>

* We will also usually benefit from the summary:


```r
summary(gapminder)
```

```

```

========================================================
<h3>A realistic dataframe -- continued</h3>

* We also often benefit from looking at a sub-slice of the data to "feel" what kind of data we are working with.

* This is commonly done with the ``head()`` function;

  * this will extract the leading rows of the dataframe for examination:


```r
head(gapminder)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 6
  country     continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
  <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
1 Afghanistan Asia       1952    28.8  8425333      779.
2 Afghanistan Asia       1957    30.3  9240934      821.
3 Afghanistan Asia       1962    32.0 10267083      853.
4 Afghanistan Asia       1967    34.0 11537966      836.
5 Afghanistan Asia       1972    36.1 13079460      740.
6 Afghanistan Asia       1977    38.4 14880372      786.
```

========================================================
<h3>A realistic dataframe -- continued</h3>


* Similarly, we can use the ``tail()`` function to examine the trailing rows:


```r
tail(gapminder)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 6
  country  continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
  <fct>    <fct>     <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
1 Zimbabwe Africa     1982    60.4  7636524      789.
2 Zimbabwe Africa     1987    62.4  9216418      706.
3 Zimbabwe Africa     1992    60.4 10704340      693.
4 Zimbabwe Africa     1997    46.8 11404948      792.
5 Zimbabwe Africa     2002    40.0 11926563      672.
6 Zimbabwe Africa     2007    43.5 12311143      470.
```

========================================================
<h3>Extracting sub-sets of data</h3>

*  We might be interested in a particular country, let's say India;

  * we can, for example, make a sub-dataframe based on the cases corresponding to India alone:
  

```r
india_index <- gapminder$country == "India"
```

* In the above, we have constructed a logical vector for the purpose of indexing the <b>rows</b> which correspond to India.

  * Any row which contains the factor level ``India`` in the ``country`` factor vector will correspond to a ``TRUE`` in the logical vector ``india_index``.
  
  * Any row which does not contain the factor level ``India`` will respectively correspond to a ``FALSE``.

========================================================
<h3>A realistic dataframe -- continued</h3>

* Here, we will extract the India data based on the logical indexing and examine the sub-dataframe:


```r
india_dataframe <- gapminder[india_index, ]
head(india_dataframe)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 6
  country continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap
  <fct>   <fct>     <int>   <dbl>     <int>     <dbl>
1 India   Asia       1952    37.4 372000000      547.
2 India   Asia       1957    40.2 409000000      590.
3 India   Asia       1962    43.6 454000000      658.
4 India   Asia       1967    47.2 506000000      701.
5 India   Asia       1972    50.7 567000000      724.
6 India   Asia       1977    54.2 634000000      813.
```

========================================================
<h2>Basic plotting</h2>

* R has several different kinds of plotting commands and libraries;

  * for simple plots, intended as exploratory analysis, we often will use the "base" R plotting.
  
* For more advanced control and formatting, we will typically use a more sophisticated library, such as ``ggplot2``;

  * learning to use advanced plotting will be in the homework assignment.
  
========================================================
<h3>Basic plotting -- continued</h3>


* If we want to create a quick exploratory "x-y" plot of some relationship, this can be done with the ``plot()`` function.

* For example, we will plot the change of life expectancy over time in India:


```r
plot(india_dataframe$year, india_dataframe$lifeExp) 
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-64](lesson_19_08_29-figure/unnamed-chunk-64-1.png)
  
========================================================
<h3>Basic plotting -- continued</h3>

* In the last command, we can adjust labels and plot sizes with additional arguments in the plot function;
  
  * these arguments and "keywords" can be found in the help file for plot, using ``?plot``.


```r
par(mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
plot(india_dataframe$year, india_dataframe$lifeExp, cex=3, cex.lab=3, cex.axis=2) 
```

========================================================
<h2>For next time</h2>

* We will begin doing math next time.

  * The first homework will be to practice programming skills discussed this week.
  
  * If you need additional practice, continue the lessons in Software Carpentry on your own.
  
  * You will have some time to learn additional programming skills before we start modeling in the homework.
  
  * We will start with simple examples and theory for understanding fundamentals;
  
  * once we have established the fundamentals, we will begin more realistic practice with the tools as discussed this week.
