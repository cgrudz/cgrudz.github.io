<h1>Review from last time...</h1>

* We noted that Gaussianity of the error wasn't required by the Gauss-Markov theorem, rather this gauranteed that least-squares was the <emph>maximum likelihood estimator</em>.

* Without Gaussianity of the errors, least-squares is still the best linear unbiased estimator, but we may find that a linear model in itself is not appropriate.

* Additionally, our confidence intervals and hypothesis tests utilized the Gaussian assumption on the error.

* However, we can sometimes make due "OK" with slightly innacurate uncertainty quantification, if the <b>sample sizes are sufficiently large</b>...
  
* Particularly, the hypothesis testing and confidence intervals we have developed can be understood as good approximations due to the central limit theorem.


========================================================

<h2> Central limit theorem</h2>

* Suppose we have a sequence of random variables, $\left\{X_i \right\}_{i=1}^\infty$ which are independent, identically disributed <emph>from any distribution</emph>, such that for all $i$
<ol>
  <li> $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu$; and</li>
  <li> $var(X_i) = \sigma^2$, for some finite $\sigma$.</li>
</ol>

* For each $n\geq 1$ define the sample based mean of the sequence $\left\{X_i \right\}_{i=1}^n$

  $$\begin{align}
  \tilde{X}_n \triangleq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
  \end{align}$$

* Then, as the number of random variables $n\rightarrow \infty$, the sample-based means
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \sqrt{n}\left(\tilde{X}_n - \mu\right) {\xrightarrow {d}} N(0, \sigma^2)
  \end{align}$$
  where the convergence is in distribution.
  
* Put another way, for $n$ sufficiently large, $\tilde{X}_n$ has <b>approximately</b> a $N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ distribution.

* Therefore, <b>for large sample sizes</b>, we can produce confidence intervals for the mean of the unbiased estimator (the true $\boldsymbol{\beta}$) from the sample based estimate (the least squares solution $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$) as usual, which will <b>be a good approximation</b> if not strictly accurate.

========================================================

<h3> A summary of issues with non-Gaussianity</h3>

* Generally, when facing a non-Gaussian error distribution the solution will depend on the types of issues detected.

* For a large number of observations, we can usually ignore issues of non-Gaussianity for uncertainty quantification due to the Central Limit Theorem.

* This is also often the case for short-tailed disributions.

* For skewed distributions, a nonlinear tranformation of the response may alleviate the issuse, 
  
  * e.g., log transformation or square-root.

* For long-tailed distributions, we may need to use more robust methods, e.g. bootstrapping (not covered in lecture but discussed in the text).

========================================================

<h2> Correlated Errors</h2>

* There aren't very general methods for testing for the correlation of the errors $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$, i.e.,

  * let 
  
   $$\begin{align}
    cov\left(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\right)\triangleq &\mathbb{E}\left[\boldsymbol{\epsilon} \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^\mathrm{T}\right] = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^2,
    \end{align}$$ 
  
  then it is difficult generally to test based on the residuals if the non-diagonal entries of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ are non-zero.
  
  * That is, whether we can even write 
  
  $$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^2 = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \sigma_1^2 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\    
    0 & \sigma_2^2 & \cdots & \vdots \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & \cdots & \sigma_n
  \end{pmatrix}$$
  for possibly different $\sigma_i$, but strictly diagonal.


========================================================
    
  * Recall that even when $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^2 = \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}$, the residuals are not generally uncorrelated as,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  cov \left( \hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}} \right) = \sigma^2 \left(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{H}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  
* Therefore, we must usually anticipate the issues from the structure of the problem itself, e.g,
<ol>
  <li>in time series problems, we shoud check for time correlation of the errors; </li>
  <li>in spatial data, we should check for correlation in the errors spatially;</li>
  <li>data collected in particular batches should be checked for correlations between observations within particular batches;</li>
  <li>etc...</li>
</ol>
    
* Typically, this will include (as usual) a mixture of visual inspection to feel the data for issues, and numerical verification of our intuition.

* <b>mongolia</b> - is tree ring proxy information from Mongolia.

* <b>tasman</b> - is tree ring proxy informatino from Tasmania.

* In the tail, we have accurate temperature measurements into the year 2000.

* The default behavior in R is to omit any lines where there are missing values, so we can fit the model directly only on the years 1856-2000 as below:


```r
lmod <- lm(nhtemp ~ wusa + jasper + westgreen + chesapeake + tornetrask + urals + mongolia + tasman, globwarm)
```

========================================================

* <b>Q:</b> What kind of plot would make sense in this instance to study the <emph>time-correlation</emph> of the errors?

* <b>A:</b> we can once again plot the residuals, but in this context versus the time variable


```r
par(mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
plot(residuals(lmod) ~ year, na.omit(globwarm), ylab="Residuals", cex=3, cex.lab=3, cex.axis=1.5)
abline(h=0)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](lesson_19_03_29-figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

* <b>Q:</b> do we detect any structure to the residuals?

========================================================

* Given the last diagnostic, it appears that the residuals are positively correlated in time, 
  
  * that is, the residual in the last time step appears to largely be similar to the outcome of the subsequent.

*  Therefore, we will plot the residual one step in time forward as a function of the residual one step in time backward: 


```r
par(mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
n <- length(residuals(lmod))
plot(tail(residuals(lmod),n-1) ~ head(residuals(lmod),n-1), xlab=expression(hat(epsilon)[i]),ylab=expression(hat(epsilon)[i+1]),  cex=3, cex.lab=3, cex.axis=1.5)
abline(h=0,v=0,col=grey(0.75))
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](lesson_19_03_29-figure/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

========================================================

* The former plot strongly suggests a linear relationship between the residuals between subseqent time steps.
 
  * We note that in the former plot, the intercept term is zero as the residuals have mean zero (for an unbiased model).
  
* To verify our visual inspection numerically, we fit a linear model (without intercept) for the plot studied earlier:


```r
sumary(lm(tail(residuals(lmod),n-1) ~ head(residuals(lmod),n-1) -1))
```

```
                             Estimate Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)
head(residuals(lmod), n - 1) 0.595076   0.069312  8.5855 1.391e-14

n = 144, p = 1, Residual SE = 0.13918, R-Squared = 0.34
```

* The $R^2$ value is somewhat small in this case, indicating that the variation of the trend isn't fully explained by the linear relationship.

* However, the p-value indicates total certainty that there is some relationship between the residuals at consecutive time steps --- this indicates that there is indeed time-correlation of the residuals (and errors).

========================================================

<h3> Durbin-Watson test </h3>

* If we wish to evaluate the previous question formally in terms of hypothesis testing, we can consider the Durbin-Watson test.

* Generally speaking, the Durbin-Watson test is a test-statistic to study the auto-correlation, lag 1 in the residuals, from a regression analysis.

* Suppose we have a linear relationship defined in terms of the lag 1 residuals, i.e.,

  $$\begin{align}
  \hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_t = \rho  \hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{t-1} + \nu_t
  \end{align}$$
  
  where:
  <ol>
    <li>$\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_t$ is the residual at time $t$ in the time series;</li>
    <li>$\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{t-1}$ is the residual at the time measured one step before;</li>
    <li>$\rho$ is a constant scalar, giving the slope of the relationship; and</li>
    <li>$\nu_t$ is the random variation around the linear signal between time steps.</li>
  </ol>

<ul>
<li> Given the lag-one autocorrelation model in the residuals, $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_t = \rho  \hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{t-1} + \nu_t$, we will consider the following hypotheses:</li>

<li>
  $$\begin{align}
  H_0: &\rho = 0 \\
  H_1: &\rho \neq 0
  \end{align}$$
  
  where the null corresponds to the absence of a time-correlation of the residuals.</li>
<li> Under the null hypothesis, the following,

  $$\begin{align}
  DW \triangleq \frac{\sum_{i=2}^n \left(\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{i} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_{i-1}\right)^2 }{\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_i^2}
  \end{align}$$
  is distributed according to a linear combination of $\chi^2$ distributions (example Chi-squared distributions pictured left).
</ul>  
</div>

========================================================

* In R, we can perform the test using the package "lmtest"


```r
require("lmtest")
dwtest(nhtemp ~ wusa + jasper + westgreen + chesapeake + tornetrask + urals + mongolia + tasman, data=globwarm)
```

```

	Durbin-Watson test

data:  nhtemp ~ wusa + jasper + westgreen + chesapeake + tornetrask +     urals + mongolia + tasman
DW = 0.81661, p-value = 1.402e-15
alternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is greater than 0
```

* The p-value is effectively zero, so we can conclude with almost $100\%$ confidence that the errors are time-correlated.

* We will evaluate later how to deal with some of the issues with correlation in errors with generalized least squares.


========================================================

<h2> Unusual observations</h2>

* We saw outliers earlier in the "fat" data, generated by, e.g.,  measurement error/ incorrectly input data (the 2.5' 200lb individual):
  

```r
par(mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
hist(fat$height, xlab = "Height in inches", main="",  cex=3, cex.lab=3, cex.axis=1.5)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8](lesson_19_03_29-figure/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

and extreme/ abnormal cases (the 350+ lbs individual):


```r
par(mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
hist(fat$weight, xlab = "Weight in lbs", main="",  cex=3, cex.lab=3, cex.axis=1.5)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9](lesson_19_03_29-figure/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)
  
========================================================

* Unusual observations can have a dramatic impact on the performance of a regression model.

* Outliers are those observations that don't fit the overall trend or the linear model well.

* Some observations can have their own dramatic impact on the performance of the model,
  
  * we denote these observations <b>influential observations</b>

* It is possible that an observation is either, both or neither an outlier or influential.

* A <b>leverage point</b> is an extreme value of one of the <em>explanatory variables</em>, that has <em>potential</em> to influence the fit of the model.

* It is important to identify any of the above such points, but the choice of what to do with them will depend significantly on the problem at hand.

========================================================

<h3>Leverage</h3>

* We will first study the leverage points. 

* Recall the "hat" matrix that projects the observations into the space of the explanatory variables,

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathbf{H}&\triangleq \mathbf{X}\left(\mathbf{X}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{X} \right)^{-1}\mathbf{X}^\mathrm{T}
  \end{align}$$

* Usign the hat matrix, we define the fitted values via the relationship,

  $$\begin{align}
  \hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{Y}.
  \end{align}$$

* Therefore, consider the derivative of the $i$-th fitted value $\hat{\mathbf{Y}}_i$ with respect to the $j$-th observation of the response,

  $$\begin{align}
  \partial_{\mathbf{Y}_j} \mathbf{Y}_i &= \partial_{\mathbf{Y}_j} \left(\mathbf{H} \mathbf{Y}\right) \\
  & =\mathbf{H}_{ij}.
  \end{align}$$
  
* Thus, the <b>sensitivity</b> of the $i$-th fitted value (prediction) with respect to the $j$-th observed value is given precisely by the entry $(i,j)$ of the hat matrix, $\mathbf{H}_{ij}$.  

* For this reason, the entries of the projection operator $\mathbf{H}$ can be considered to be,

  1. $\mathbf{H}_{ii}$ --- the <b>self-sensitivity or leverage</b> of the fitted value $\hat{\mathbf{Y}}_{i}$ with respect to the variation of the observation $\mathbf{Y}_i$; while
  
  2. $\mathbf{H}_{ij}$ --- the <b>cross-sensitivity</b> of the fitted value $\hat{\mathbf{Y}}_{i}$ with respect to the variation of the observation $\mathbf{Y}_j$.

========================================================

  
* Recall that, under the condition of $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\sim N\left(0,\sigma^2 \mathbf{I}\right)$

  $$\begin{align}
  cov\left(\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}\right) = \sigma^2\left(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{H}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  
* Denote the $i$-th self-sensitivty or leverage,

  $$\begin{align}
  h_i \triangleq \mathbf{H}_{ii} 
  \end{align}$$


* From above, the variance of the $i$-th residual is given,

  $$\begin{align}
  \sigma^2 \left(1 - h_i\right)
  \end{align}$$
  
* This implies that the values of the leverages will have a strong impact on the variance of the residuals.

* Specifically, if
<ol>
  <li> the $i$-th leverage is zero, the model effectively ignores the impact of the $i$-th observation on the $i$-th fitted value and the variation of this residual is the same as the random variation in the signal.</li>
  <li> the $i$-th leverage is one, the model effectively sets the fitted value to the observed value, and there is zero variation of the $i$-th residual. </li>
</ol>

========================================================

* To understand large leverages, we can consider how this relates to a weighted distance function:

  $$\begin{align}
  \left( \mathbf{x} - \overline{ \mathbf{x}}\right)^\mathrm{T} \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1} \left(\mathbf{x} - \overline{\mathbf{x}}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  
  where $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$ represents the mean of the explanatory variables and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$.
  
* The above quantity is known as the Mahalanobis distance function;

* Generally, for a point in space $p$ and a distribution $f$, the Mahalanobis distance is a multidimensional generalization of the idea of, 
<ul>
   <li> "how many standard deviations is the point $p$ from the center of mass for the distibution $f$?"</li>
<li> Intuitively, this is represented by
  <ol>
  <li>centering the usual distance at the mean, via the difference,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \mathbf{x} - \hat{\mathbf{x}};
  \end{align}$$
  
  (i.e., the size of the anomaly) and</li>
  
  <li> weighting the distance from the center based upon the spread of the data, as represented by the (co)-variances in $\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$.</li>
  
  </ol>
</ul>

* If the data was mean zero, completely uncorrelated, uniform and unit variation in every direction, this would become the standard Euclidean distance,

  $$\begin{align}
  \left(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{0} \right)^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{I} \left(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{0} \right) = \mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{x}
  \end{align}$$
  
========================================================

* The connection between leverage and the Mahalanobis distance is that,

  $$\begin{align}
 h_i \equiv \frac{\left[\left(\mathbf{X}_{ii} - \overline{\mathbf{X}}\right)^\mathrm{T} \hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1} \left(\mathbf{X}_{ii} - \overline{\mathbf{X}}\right)\right]^2}{ \left(n-1\right)} + \frac{1}{n}
  \end{align}$$
  
* Correspondingly, if an observed value for an explanatory variable $\mathbf{X}_{ii}$ is far from the center of the data according to the weighted distance, the fitted value is highly sensitive to this observed value.

* Leverage can be understood "mechanically" where applying force to a lever at a point far from the fulcrum exerts a large force.

* Note: leverages only contain information from the explanatory variables $\mathbf{X}$ and not the observations of the response $\mathbf{Y}$, and therefore only contain <em>partial</em> information, in some sense...

========================================================

* We recall some properties about projection operators.  

* Suppose $\mathbf{H}$ is an orthogonal projection operator into the space spanned by the columns of the matrix $\mathbf{X}$.

* Let the vectors $\left\{\mathbf{x}_i\right\}_{i=1}^p$ form a basis for the column span of $\mathbf{X}$.

* Let the vectors $\left\{\mathbf{v}_i\right\}_{i=p+1}^{n}$ form a basis for the orthogonal complement to the column span of $\mathbf{X}$.

* Then:

  <ol>
    <li> $\mathbf{H}\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{x}_i$ for each $i=1,\cdots ,p$, such that we can see immediately $\mathbf{H}$ has $p$ eigenvalues equal to one.</li>
    <li> $\mathbf{H}\mathbf{v}_i = 0$ for each $i = p+1, \cdots, n$, such that we can see immediately that $\mathbf{H}$ has $n-p$ eigenvalues equal to zero.
  </ol>

* Let  $\mathbf{A}$ be any matrix.  Recall that the trace of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the following relationships:

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{A}\right) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{A}_{ii} \\
   &= \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i
  \end{align}$$
  
  where the $\mathbf{A}_{ii}$ are the diagonal entries of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
  
========================================================

*  Using the properties from the previous slide, we can conclude immediately that the sum of the leverages,

  $$\begin{align}
  \sum_{i=1}^n h_i = p
  \end{align}$$
  
* An average value for one leverage on the other hand is $\frac{p}{n}$.  

*To say that a leverage is equal to one means that this leverage <b>uses an entire degree of freedom</b> when fitting the data.


========================================================


* As a rough diagnostic, we can say large leverages of size greater than or equal to $\frac{2p}{n}$ should be evaluated carefully.

* We will examine the savings data once again, in this case to inspect for large leverages:


```r
lmod <- lm(sr ~ pop15 + pop75 + dpi + ddpi, savings)
hatv <- hatvalues(lmod)
sum(hatv)
```

```
[1] 5
```

```r
length(lmod$fitted.values)
```

```
[1] 50
```

```r
hatv[hatv > (2 * sum(hatv) / length(lmod$fitted.values))]
```

```
      Ireland         Japan United States         Libya 
    0.2122363     0.2233099     0.3336880     0.5314568 
```

* Here we find four leverages worth investigating the behavior of, based on the above criterion.

* We can likewise make a visual inspection for outliers in the leverages with a Q-Q plot versus a half normal.

  * Note: in this case, we are not expecting the leverages to follow the half normal distribution (i.e., forming a line in the central diagonal).  Rather, we are only inspecting for extreme data.

========================================================


* Here we plot the ordered values of the leverages (y-axis) versus the quantiles of the Half-normal distribution.

* In particular, we plot the most extreme leverages with their name as corresponds to the previous analysis.

* The criterion value for the large leverages $y= \frac{2p}{n}$ is plotted additionally.


```r
par(mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
countries <- row.names(savings)
halfnorm(hatv,labs=countries,ylab="Leverages",  cex=3, cex.lab=3, cex.axis=1.5)
abline(h = (2 * sum(hatv) / length(lmod$fitted.values)))
```

<h3> Standardized residuals</h3>


* It is often the case, as in the difference between covariance and correlation, that we wish to standardize the variances to a unit quantity for comparison.

* This is likewise the case with the residuals of our model, and this can be performed precisely with respect to the leverages.

* Particularly, with

  $$\begin{align}
  var\left(\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_i\right) = \sigma^2 \left(1 - h_i \right), 
  \end{align}$$

* this suggests the standardization of the residuals as,

  $$\begin{align}
  r_i \triangleq \frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_i}{\hat{\sigma} \sqrt{1 - h_i}}
  \end{align}$$
  
* When all of our assumptions hold true, the relationship between the standardized residuals and the residuals are the analogue of correlation as the normalized covariances.

  * Particularly, $var(r_i) =1$ and $cov(r_i, r_j) \approx 0$ for $i\neq j$. 

========================================================
  
* When there is constant variance in the actual variation $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$, but the residuals $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}$ have some natural variation leading to non-constant variance, the standardized residuals can perform as better diagnostic plots.

* However, if there is non-constant variance of $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$, standardization fails to correct for this.


```r
par(mai=c(1.5,1.5,.5,.5), mgp=c(3,0,0))
qqnorm(rstandard(lmod), main = "", cex=3, cex.lab=3, cex.axis=1.5)
abline(0,1)
```

* The benefit in the above plot is that the size of the standardized residuals can be evaluated with respect to the standard normal --- a value of 2 is large but unexceptional for the standard normal, whereas a value of e.g., 4 would be of concern.
