<div id="late-policy-and-exceptions" class="section level2">
<h2>Late policy and exceptions</h2>
<p>There are no makeups for quizzes, exams or homework except for university recognized activities or exceptional circumstances, as per university policy. A midterm score can be replaced with the final exam score only once and only for a documented legitimate reason (doctor’s note, University activity, religious observance etc.). If a student needs to miss class due to participation in official university activities or a religious observance, they <strong>must make arrangements with the instructor at least one week prior to the date in question – the absence will not be given consideration without this advanced notice</strong>. In cases of absences due to extended illness, family emergency, bereavement, or other compelling reason, students should notify the instructor as soon as possible and <strong>within one week of the start of the absence</strong>. The instructor has the right to request formal, written documentation in such cases as they deem appropriate. Please see the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/administrative-manual/3000-3999-students/3020-class-absence-policy">full policy statement on absences</a>.</p>
<p>In any other circumstance, there will not be makeups for exams or homework. However, the three lowest lowest homework scores and three lowest quiz scores will be dropped for each student to accommodate unexpected circumstances.</p>
