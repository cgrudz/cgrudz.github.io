<ul>
   <li>We will begin a review of hypothesis testing -- recall:</li>
   <ol>  
      <li><b>$H_0$</b> -- <strong>this is the null hypothesis</strong>.</li>
      <ul>
         <li>The null hypothesis is <b>symbolically</b> a statement about some <b style="color:#1b9e77">population parameter</b> <strong>begin equal $(=)$ to some value</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>$H_1$</b> -- <strong>this is the alternative hypothesis</strong>.</li>
      <ul>
         <li>The alternative hypothesis is the statement that the <b style="color:#1b9e77">population parameter</b> is <strong>different than the null</strong>.</li>
         <li><b>Symbolically</b>, it will always take the form of <strong>$( &gt; / &lt; / \neq)$</strong> in terms of the <b style="color:#1b9e77">parameter</b> in question.</li>
         <li>The form of the alternative hypothesis determines whether we consider a:</li>
         <ol>
            <li><b>$&lt;$</b> -- left-sided test;</li>
            <li><b>$&gt;$</b> -- right-sided test; or a</li>
            <li><b>$\neq$</b> -- two-sided test;</li>
         </ol>
         <li>in the measure of "extremeness" of the test statistic with respect to the null hypothesis.</li>
      </ul>
   </ol>
   <li>Typically, our <b>research hypothesis</b> is phrased in terms of an <strong>inequality so that it is written as the alternative hypothesis</strong>.</li>  
</ul>

</p>
</div>   
<div style="float:left; width:55%"> 
<ul>
   <li>The first step is thus to <b>identify the claim</b> and <strong>write it as an equality, or more typically as an inequality</strong>.</li>
   <li>We then write the contradictory claim and identify the <b>null hypothesis $H_0$</b> <strong>$(=)$</strong> and <b>alternative hypothesis $H_1$</b> <strong>$(&lt; / &gt; / \neq)$</strong>.</li>
   <li>We then <b>assume the null hypothesis</b> and <strong>select a significance level $\alpha$</strong>.</li>
   <ul>
      <li>The significance level $\alpha$ is defined as<b>
      $$\begin{align}
      \alpha= P(\text{Rejecting the null }H_0\text{ when }H_0\text{ is actually true}).
      \end{align}$$</b></li>
   </ul>
   <li>This is precisely due to the fact that,
   <blockquote>
   we reject the null hypothesis when the probability of observing a sample at-least-as extreme as our test statistic is less than $\alpha$, under the assumption of $H_0$.
   </blockquote></li>
   <li>The test statistic is the evidence from sampling that we compare with the null hypothesis;</li>
   <ul>
      <li>there is a possiblity that we <strong>incorrectly reject $H_0$</strong> due to chance based on sampling error, and this is with <b>probability $\alpha$</b>.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>This type of mistake is known as <b>type I error</b>, or a <strong>false positive in terms of favoring the alternative</strong>.</li>
   <li>We measure <strong>how extreme a test statistic</strong> is (usually) with <b>P-values</b> or (less commonly) with <b>critical values</b>.</li>  
</ul> 
</div>

</div>
<div style="float:left; width:45%"> 
<ul>
   <li>Actually, P-values and critical values are <strong>equivalent representations</strong> of the same measure of <b>at-least-as-extreme</b> as.</li>
   <li>In the case of critical values, we construct the region for which:</li>
   <ol>
      <li><b>$H_1:&lt;$</b> -- there is probability of $\alpha$ for randomly selecting an observation to the left of this region;</li>
      <li><b>$H_1:&gt;$</b> -- there is a probability of $\alpha$ for randomly selecting an observation to the right of this region; or</li>
      <li><b>$H_1: \neq$</b> -- there is a probability of $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ of randomly selecting an observation to the left, or $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ of randomly selecting an observation to the right.</li>
   </ol>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
   <li>With P-values, instead of graphically considering the region, we numerically compute the probability (P-value) of randomly selecting an observation at-least-as extreme as our test statistic directly.</li>
   <li>We make the same considerations as above with respect to the form of the alternative hypothesis when we compute this probability.</li>
   <li>For left or right sided tests, we find the <strong>probability of randomly selecting an observation at-least-as far left / far right</strong> (<b>$H_1: &lt;$</b> or <b>$H_1: &gt;$</b>).</li>
   <li>For two sided tests, we find the <strong>probability of randomly selecting an observation at-least-as far from the center in either direction</strong> <b>$H_1:\neq$</b>.</li>
</ul>
</div>


========================================================

## Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing

<ul>
   <li>Before we go through examples, we should make one note about the correspondence between hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.</li>
   <li>Actually, <b>hypothesis tests / confidence intervals of the mean and the standard deviation</b>, these are <strong>totally equivalent</strong>.</li>
   <li>Indeed, let us suppose that we have some confidence interval,
   $$(\overline{x} - E, \overline{x} - E)$$
   at a $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$ level of confidence.</li>
   <li>Remember, this confidence interval depends on a random realization of the <b style="color:#d95f02">sample mean $\overline{x}$</b> and, possibly, a random realization of the <b style="color:#d95f02">sample standard deviation $s$</b>.</li>
   <li>Suppose we had a <b>hypothetical value for the mean $\tilde{\mu}$</b> that we wanted to test as the null,
   $$H_0: \mu = \tilde{\mu},$$
   with $\alpha$ significance.</li>
   <li>If we found that <strong>$\tilde{\mu}$ was not in the interval</strong>
   $$(\overline{x} - E, \overline{x} + E),$$
   we could equivalently <b>reject the null $H_0:\mu=\tilde{\mu}$ with $\alpha$ significance</b>.</li>
   <li>The same is not true for hypothesis tests and our earlier confidence intervals of population proportions, due to the approximations we made for this confidence interval.</li>
   <li>More advanced techniques, mentioned briefly, don't suffer from this inconsistency however, and modern statistical software can make this consistent in the calculation.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div style="float:left; width:70%"> 
<ul>
   <li>We will now demonstrate how to solve the earlier example of drone-based delivery but with technology, in both the P-value and critical value methods.</li>
   <li>Let's recall that there were $n=1009$ total observations in the survey in which participants were asked if they were uncomfortable with drone-based delivery of household goods.</li>
   <li>$545$ participants responded that they were uncomfortable with drone-based delivery.</li>
   <li>This means that using the <b>normal distribution approximation is OK</b>, because there are at <strong>least $5$ successes and at least $5$ failures</strong>, when we count a success as a response is opposed to drone-based delivery.</li>
   <li>The null and alternative hypotheses were given
   $$\begin{align}
   H_0:p=0.5 & & H_1: p&gt; 0.5.
   \end{align}$$
   and we selected a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$.</li>
   <li>We computed the test statistic as,
   $$\frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sqrt{\frac{p\times q}{n}}} = \frac{0.540 - 0.50}{\sqrt{\frac{0.5\times 0.5}{1006}}} \approx 2.54.$$</li>
   <li>To the left, we see equivalent wasy of viewing the test statistic -- on the top with the P-value and on the bottom with the critical region with $z_\alpha = 1.645$ corresponding to $\alpha\times 100\% = 5\%$.</li>
   <li>We will now go through how to compute both of these directly in StatCrunch.</li>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================

### Examples of testing hypotheses for a population proportion continued

<ul>
   <li>Let us now consider a new example.</li>
   <li>In a study in Neurology magazine, the authors found that approximately $29.2\%$ of studied participants among $19,136$ total had sleepwalked at some point.</li>
   <li><b>Consider the following:</b>  let $p$ be the population parameter for the number of US adults who have sleep walked.</li>  
   <li>Suppose we want to claim that fewer than $30\%$ of the population of US adults have sleepwalked.  What would be the appropriate null $H_0$ and alternative $H_1$ hypothesis in this case?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Notice that our claim is given as $p< 0.3$, so that the contradictory claim would be given as $p\geq 0.3$.</li>
      <li>Then, the smallest proportion of US adults who could have sleepwalked without being less than $30\%$ is exactly $p=0.3$.</li>
      <li>When we identify the null hypothesis $H_0:=$ and the alternative hypothesis $H_1: &gt; / &lt; / \neq$, we should find
      $$\begin{align}
      H_0: p=0.3 & & H_1: p &lt; 0.3.
      \end{align}$$</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Suppose we want to test this hypothesis with a significance level of $\alpha =0.05$.  Recall that in StatCrunch we had to input the total number of observations and the total number of successes.</li>
   <li>However, we only have a value of $\hat{p}=29.2\%$ of the sample in this case.</li>
   <li><b>Consider the following:</b> if $x$ is the value of the number of successes, i.e., the number total participants in the sample who have sleep walked, how can we find this from the above?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Recall, $\hat{p}= \frac{x}{n}$ so that,
      $$n \times \hat{p} = 19136 \times 0.292 = 5587.712 \approx x .$$</li>
      <li>We need to round this to a whole number of participants, so the closest one is $x= 5588$, which we will take in this example.</li>   
   </ul>
</ul>

========================================================

### Examples of testing hypotheses for a population proportion continued

<ul>
   <li>Recall, our test statistic for the hypothesis test is the z score of $\hat{p} = \frac{5588}{19136}$ under the null hypothesis that the mean of the sampling distribution is $p =0.3$, with standard deviation (standard error)
   $$\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p\times q }{n}}.$$
   </li>
   <li><b>Consider the following:</b> can you compute the test statistic given the above information?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Given the above, we have $q = 1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7$ so that the z score is given
      $$z = \frac{\hat{p} - p }{\sqrt{\frac{p\times q}{n}}} =\frac{\frac{5588}{19136} - 0.3}{\sqrt{\frac{0.3\times 0.7}{19136}}}\approx -2.41$$
   </ul>
   <li>If you remember the value for the $z_\alpha = z_{0.05}\approx 1.645$ you can deduce the critical region for the left-sided hypothesis test by the symmetry of the normal distribution.</li>
   <li>However, we will now use StatCrunch to evaluate the hypothesis directly in the following.</li>   
</ul>

========================================================

### Examples of testing hypotheses for a population proportion continued

<ul>
   <li>We should emphasize that using the <b>z score as the test statistic</b> is usually only appropriate when there are <strong>at least $5$ successes and at least $5$ failures for the binomial trial</strong>.</li>
   <li>This is what allows us to use the <b>normal distribution</b> as a good <strong>approximation for the binomial distribution</strong>.</li>
   <li>However, when we use statistical software, we will usually compute the test statistic exactly from the binomial distribution, without the normal approximation.</li>
   <li>Therefore, we can make a hypothesis test with a small number of samples using statistical software directly.</li>
   <li>Suppose we have a small sample size of $10$ couples who are given a fertility treatment which is claimed to increase the rate of new born girls above $75\%$.</li>
   <li><b>Consider the following:</b> let's suppose that $9$ out of $10$ babies are girls -- can we claim with $\alpha=0.05$ significance that this is correct?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Notice that if $p$ is the population proportion of girls born under the treatment then
      $$\begin{align}
      H_0:p=0.75 && H_1:p>0.75
      \end{align}$$
      as $p=0.75$ is the largest proportion of baby girls that can contradict the claim.</li>
      <li>The z score is no longer relevant here because we have too few samples, but we can compute the hypothesis test directly in StatCrunch as follows.</li>
   </ul>
</ul>

========================================================

## Examples of testing hypotheses for a population mean

<ul>
   <li>We will now consider some examples of making hypothesis tests for a population mean.</li> 
   <li>We should recall here the requirements that we have for making such a test, which are the same as for computing a confidence interval:</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Observations should come from <b>simple random sampling</b>.</li>
      <li>The observations $x_1, \cdots, x_n$ can come from <b>any underlying distribution</b>...</li>
      <li> however, if it is <b>non-normal</b>, <strong>there should be $n&gt;30$ observations in the sample for the distribution of $\overline{x}$ to be sufficiently normal</strong>.</li>
      <li>Generally we <b>do not know $\sigma$</b>, and in this case we use the test statistic,
      $$\frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}},$$
      distributed according to a <b>student t</b> with <strong>$n-1$ degrees of freedom</strong>.</li>
      <li>In the rare case when <b>$\sigma$ is known</b>, we can use the test statistic,
      $$\frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$
      which is distributed as a <b>standard normal</b>.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>In general, we will of course try to use modern statistical software to make these computations, but it is important to understand how these pieces fit together even when we use software.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
   <li>Let's suppose that the $n=12$ observations to the left come from a simple random sample of US adults.</li>
   <li>The measurments are the number of hours of sleep that each individual has per night on average over the year.</li>
   <li>The sample mean is given as $\overline{x}\approx 6.8333$ hours and the sample standard deviation is given as $s =1.9924$ hours.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
   <li><b>Consider the following</b> can we use a hypothesis test with this data to claim with $\alpha=0.05$ significance that the population mean number of hours of sleep is less than $7$ hours?  Are the necessary assumptions satisfied?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Using the histogram and the Q-Q plot, we can see that the <b>sample is approximately normal</b>:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>there is a <strong>symmetric bell shape to the histogram with no outliers, and the Q-Q plot roughly follows the diagonal line</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Then, given the above claim we have,
      $$\begin{align}
      H_0: \mu = 0.7 & & H_1: \mu &lt; 0.7
      \end{align}$$
      as $\mu=0.7$ is the largest number of hours of sleep that contradicts the above claim.</li>
      <li>The test statistic is thus given as
      $$\frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{6.8333 - 0.7 }{\frac{1.9924}{\sqrt{12}}} \approx -0.290.$$

   <li>From the last slide we had a test statistic
      $$\frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{6.8333 - \mu }{\frac{1.9924}{\sqrt{12}}} \approx -0.290.$$   
      which must be <b>t distributed</b> because we used the <b style="color:#d95f02">sample standard deviation $s$</b>.</li>
   <li>Also, we know that with $n=12$ observations, we have precisely <b>$n-1=11$ degrees of freedom</b> for the student t distribution.</li>

### Examples of testing hypotheses for a population mean continued

<ul>
   <li>As a final example, we will consider the claim that the population mean body temperature is $\mu=98.6$ degrees F.</li>
   <li>We suppose that we have have $n=106$ observations with a sample mean of $98.20$ degrees F, and a sample standard deviation of $s= 0.62$ degrees F, and that we wish to test this with $\alpha=0.05$ significance.</li>
   <li><b>Consider the following:</b> in this example, what are the null and alternative hypotheses?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>In this case, the <b>contradictory claim</b> is <strong>actually the alternative hypothesis</strong>,
      $$\begin{align}
      H_0: \mu = 98.6 & & H_1: \mu \neq 98.6
      \end{align}$$</li>
   </ul>
   <li>In this case, because we <b>can only reject the null in favor of the alternative</b>, <strong>we cannot provide proof that $\mu=98.6$ degrees F</strong>.</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Indeed, we only have the possibility of providing evidence that $\mu=98.6$ degrees F is unlikely.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>The test statistic,
   $$\frac{\overline{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{98.2 - 98.6}{\frac{0.62}{\sqrt{106}}} \approx -6.64.$$
   <li>We have $n=106$ observations, so we have enough data to perform the hypothesis test by the critical value method, the P-value method, or by confidence intervals for the mean.</li>
   <li>We will go through each of these in the following.</li> 
</ul>
