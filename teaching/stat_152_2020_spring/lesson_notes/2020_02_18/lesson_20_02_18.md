## Basics of probability

* In order to interpret a <b style="color:#1b9e77">population</b> from a <b style="color:#d95f02">sample</b>, we required that the sample was <strong>representative of the full population</strong>.

  * Using random chance to mix the participants in the samples was one way of ensuring that the smaller <b style="color:#d95f02">sample</b> would be a <strong>good approximation</strong> of the <b style="color:#1b9e77">population</b>.
 
* However, in any <b style="color:#d95f02">sample</b> there is natural variation amongst those sampled that leads to <strong>two repeated samples not to look like eachother</strong>.

  * One of the important considerations is thus, how likely would it be to compute a <b style="color:#d95f02">sample statistic</b> just by chance, due to the natural variation of resampling?
  
* <b>Inferential statistics</b> are differentiated from the <b>descriptive statistics</b> we have seen so far in how they address this above question.

  * Descriptive statistics help us learn about the sample we have in hand, but we must use tools from <strong>probability to address how these results might generalize to a wider population</strong>.

* One of the most important tools we will learn in this class is <b>hypothesis testing</b>, as one way to test if a claim might be infered about the wider population.

<ul>
   <li>We can take a basic example to illustrate this point.</li>
   <li> Suppose a clinical trial will be used to determine if a certain fertility treatment will increase the chance that a pregnancy will result in a female birth.</li>
   <li>There is some random chance involved in an un-assisted pregnancy whether the baby will be a girl or boy, and either result is about as likely as the other.</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Therefore, every group of $100$ births in a control group might look quite different.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>We want to find a way to be more confident that if there is an effect of the treatment, it can be distinguished from this random variation.</li> 
   <li>Formally we will make a <b>claim</b> and a <b>hypothesis</b>:</li>
   <ul>
      <li><b>Claim</b>: the fertility treatment will greatly increase the chance of a baby being born a girl over the control group.</li>
      <li><b>Hypothesis</b>: the treatment has no effect and it is equally likely that a pregnancy will result in a female or a male birth under the treatment.</li>

   <li>The purpose of the null hypothesis is to evaluate if it was likely to <strong>see our results by the natural variation in any batch of samples</strong>.</li>
   <li>Let's suppose there are two different treatments, <b>Treatment A</b> and <b>Treatment B</b> with results in the figure to the left.</li>

      <li>Under Treatment A, we suppose that out of $100$ pregnacies, $75$ girls were born and $25$ boys were born.</li>
      <li>Our null hypothesis is that even under the treatment, a female or male birth were equally likely.</li>
      <li>Threrefore, we evaluate that the chance to get <strong>at least $75$ female births out of $100$ births</strong> (with equally likely probability of a female or male) is about $3\times 10^{-7}$ or three in ten millon.</li>
      <li>Under the assumption that either a female or male birth was equally likely, this is an extremely unlikely event.</li>

## Classical approach to probability

   <li>We will generally denote some event by a capital letter, e.g.,</li>
   <ul>
      <li>$A$="one female birth, two male births".</li>
   </ul>
   <li>Then, we will denote the probability of some event $P(A)$ -- this can be read as "the probability of $A$ occuring".</li>
   <li>The <b>classical approach to probability</b> thus uses the <strong>assumption that all events in the sample space are equally likely</strong>.</li>
   <ul>

      $$\{bbg,bgb,gbb\}.$$</li>

   </li>
</ul>

========================================================

## Relative frequency approximation of probability

<ul>
   <li>The classical approach to probability works mostly for cases like games of chance, where the the sample space is limited and <strong>all outcomes are equally likely</strong>.</li>
   <li>However, many examples cannot be broken into equally likely simple events.</li>
   <ul>
      <li>Indeed, it actually is not equally likely for a birth to be either female or male, there is approximately $0.512$ probability of male.</li>
      <li>A simple counter-example is an unfair, weighted coin.</li>
      <li>We cannot accurately calculate the probability to flip a "heads" with the last rule when the coin has been weighted to come up on heads more often.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>If we don't know how the coin is weighted, a natural way to <b>approximate</b> the true probability is by <strong>replication of the process</strong>.</li>
   <ul>
      <li>For example, we can flip the coin and record whether it lands on heads or tails.</li>
      <li>Let $A=$"coin lands heads" and $B=$"coin lands tails".</li>
      <li>We will construct a frequency distribution for both of these events over many repeated flips.</li>
      <li>We will then <strong>approximate the true probability</strong> of event $A$ by the frequency of $A$ relative to all replications of the process.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>The <b>relative frequency approximation</b> is thus given as,
   $$P(A) \approx \frac{\text{Frequency event }A\text{ is observed}}{\text{Total number of times the process is repeated}}.$$</li>
   <li><b>Note</b>: this is only an approximation, and if we wanted to even closely approximate $P(A)$ for a fair coin, this <strong>requires many replications</strong>.</li>
   <li>However, this is a natural way of thinking about probability -- if we could flip a coin infinitely many times we could get the true value.</li>
</ul>

========================================================

## Probabilistic reasoning 

* More formally, this intuition is known as the "Law of large numbers".

  * If we are thinking about the fair coin flipping, as we take larger and larger approximations by the relative frequency,
  $$P(A) \approx \frac{\text{Frequency event }A\text{ is observed}}{\text{Total number of times the process is repeated}},$$
  this value will approach $.5$ with enough flips. 
  
* However, this <strong>does not imply</strong> that if we get $20$ tails in a row that we are <strong>any more likely to flip a heads</strong>.

  * This is known as the <b>gambler's fallacy</b>, where one <strong>incorrectly concludes</strong> that losing many times implies that a win is more likely.
  
* Every time we flip a fair coin, its outcome is independent of the earlier outcomes and the probability is always $50\%$ that it will land heads or tails.

  * In fact the <strong>relative frequency can go on arbitrarily large excursions</strong> away from the true probability, but the likelihood of this happening is low so that these excursions are infrequent.

* We should also note that <b>when we do not know the probability of different events</b>, <strong>it is not accurate to assign them all equal probability</strong>   .

 * For example, if we consider events $A=$"I get caught in the rain on the way to work" and $B=$"I do not get rained on", <strong>we cannot arbitrarily say that these have equal probability</strong>, i.e.,
 $$\begin{matrix} P(A) =0.5 && P(B)=0.5.\end{matrix}$$
 
 * The location of rain clouds depends strongly on land surface like mountains and atmospheric conditions like wind patterns; if I get rained on, this depends strongly on various unequal factors.

   <ul>
      <li>This will occur when we observe the event $A$ none of the times the process is replicated.</li>

   <li>Let $A$ be some event.  Then we define the <b>complementary event $\overline{A}$</b> to be all outcomes in which $A$ does not occur.</li>
   <ul>
      <li>For example, if $A=$"three male births" or $A=\{bbb\}$, then $\overline{A}$ is all other outcomes in the sample space.</li>
   </ul>
   <li><b>Discuss with a neighbor:</b> we will <strong>assume</strong> once again for simplicity that <strong>a female and male birth are equally likely</strong>.</li>
   <li>If $A=$"exactly two female births", what is the complement $\overline{A}$ and what is the probability of $\overline{A}?$</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
   <ul>
      <li>The cases when there are exactly $2$ female births are $A=\{ggb,gbg,bgg\}$.</li>
      <li>Therefore, $\overline{A}=\{bbb,bbg,bgb,gbb,ggg\}$ and $P\left(\overline{A}\right)=\frac{5}{8}$.</li>
   </ul>
   <li><b>Discuss with your neighbor:</b> what is the $P(A)$? How is this related to $P\left(\overline{A}\right)$?</li>
   <ul>
      <li>From the above, we can see $P(A)=\frac{3}{8}$.</li>

<ul>
   <li>More generally, we can think of the relationship as,
      $$\begin{align}
      P(A) &= \frac{\text{Number of ways for }A\text{ to occur}}{\text{Number of simple events}} \\
      &=\frac{\text{Number of simple events} - \text{Number of ways for }A\text{ not to occur}}{\text{Number of simple events}}\\
      &= 1 - P\left(\overline{A}\right)
      \end{align}$$</li>
   <li>That is, <strong>complimentary events have complimentary probabilities</strong>.</li>
   <li>Probability can only take values between $0$ and $1$ so that,
   $$P(A) + P\left(\overline{A}\right) = 1,$$
   as together,  all the ways $A$ can occur and all the ways $A$ cannot occur make up all possible outcomes.</li>

## Odds

* Expressions of likelihood are often given as odds, such as $50:1$ (or "50 to 1"). 

* Because the use of odds makes many calculations difficult, statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists prefer to use probabilities. 

* The advantage of odds is that they make it easier to deal with money transfers associated with gambling, so they tend to be used in casinos, lotteries, and racetracks. 

* <b>Note</b> -- in the three definitions that follow, the <b>actual odds against</b> and the <b>actual odds in favo</b>r are calculated with the <strong>actual likelihood of some event</strong>; 

  * however, the <b>payoff odds</b> describe the <strong>relationship between the bet and the amount of the payoff</strong>. 

* The actual odds correspond to actual probabilities of outcomes, but the payoff odds are set by racetrack and casino operators. 

  * Racetracks and casinos are in business to make a profit, so the payoff odds will not be the same as the actual odds.


========================================================

### Odds continued

*  <b>Actual odds against event $A$</b> -- this is the probability of event $\overline{A}$ relative to the event $A$, i.e.,<br><br>
$$\frac{P\left(\overline{A}\right)}{P(A)}$$

  *  Actualy odds against is usually expressed in the form of $a:b$ (or "$a$ to $b$"), where $a$ and $b$ are integers having no common factors.

*  <b>Actual odds in favor of event $A$</b> -- this is the probability of event $A$ relative to the event $\overline{A}$, i.e.,<br><br>
$$\frac{P(A)}{P\left(\overline{A}\right)}$$
      
   * If the odds against $A$ are $a:b$, then the odds in favor of $A$ are $b:a$.

*  <b>Payoff odds against event $A$</b> -- this is the ratio of net profit (if you win) to the amount bet:<br><br>
  $$\text{payoff odds against event }A = (\text{net profit}):(\text{amount bet})$$
