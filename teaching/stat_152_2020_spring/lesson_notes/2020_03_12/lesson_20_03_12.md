  <li>Consider modeling the amount of mail you receive each day.</li>
  <li>Suppose that expected number of pieces of mail on a given day will remain constant across any given day;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>i.e., the actual ammount will have variation but the expected amount is always the same, e.g., 4 pieces.</li>  
  </ul>
  <li> Suppose as well that the arrival times of all pieces of mail are independent;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>i.e., how many pieces of mail you receive one day does not affect future days.</li> 
  </ul>

<div style="float:left;width:100%">
<ul>  
  <li>If we wanted to model this kind of random experiment, we would call:</li>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Random experiment</b> - daily mail;</li>
    <li><b>Outcome</b> - the actual mail received;</li>
    <li><b>Random variable</b> - total number of pieces of mail.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Let's suppose that the standard deviation for the number of pieces of mail in a given day is also constant, equal to the square root of the expected number, $\sqrt{4}=2$.</li> 
  <li>If $x$ is the random variable above, typically we would model its behavior in terms of a <b>Poisson distribution</b>.</li>

  </ul>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================

## Poisson distribution

<ul>
  <li>Formally we will describe a Poisson distribution as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Suppose we have a <b>random process</b> which has <strong>outcomes measured in some interval</strong> (time / distance / volume / etc...).</li> 
    <li>Let $x$ be the <b>random variable</b> equal to the <strong>number of occurances of the random process in a given interval</strong>.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The random variable $x$ takes outcomes of the process to values in the <b>range</b> $\mathbf{R}$ <strong>including $0, 1 ,2, \cdots$ up to arbitrarily large, finite values</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Suppose that the <b>expected number of occurances</b> in any given interval is the <strong>fixed value $\mu$</strong>.</li>
    <li>Also suppose that the <b>number of occurances</b> in any given interval is <strong>independent</strong> of the number of occurances in <strong>any other given interval</strong>;</li>
    <ul>
      <li>the value $x$ attains during one (hour / mile / $\mathrm{cm}^3$ / etc...) doesn't affect the value it attains in any other.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Then, the <b>probability of exactly $x_\alpha$ occurances</b> of the process <strong>in a given interval</strong> is given by,
    $$\begin{align}
    P(x=x_\alpha) = \frac{\mu^{x_\alpha}e^{-\mu}}{x_\alpha !},
    \end{align}$$
    where:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>$e \approx 2.71828$ is known as Euler's number, the base of the natural logarithm $ln$.</li>  
      <li> the <b>meaning of the "$!$"</b> for any whole number $m$ is given by
        $$\begin{align}
        m! &= m \times (m-1) \times (m-2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1,\\
        \end{align}$$
       <b>except for $0! = 1$ which we take as definition</b>.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Note:</b> the Poisson distribution is described entirely by $\mu$ and the standard deviation of the Poisson distribution is always given as,
    $$\sigma = \sqrt{\mu}.$$</li>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

========================================================

### Poisson distribution continued

<ul>
  <li>From the last slide, the <b>probability of exactly $x_\alpha$ occurances</b> of the process <strong>in a given interval</strong> is given by,
    $$\begin{align}
    P(x=x_\alpha) = \frac{\mu^{x_\alpha}e^{-\mu}}{x_\alpha !}.
    \end{align}$$
  </li>
  <li>This expression can be analyzed as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We note that
    $$\mu^{x_\alpha}$$
    so that the <b>numerator</b> <strong>grows exponentially</strong>  as we consider larger values of $x_\alpha$.</li>  
    <li>The factorial
    $$x_\alpha ! = x_\alpha \times (x_\alpha - 1 ) \times (x_\alpha -2) \times \cdots 2 \times 1 $$
    in the <b>denominator</b> actually <strong>grows faster than exponential</strong>,</li>
    <li>however, the <b>denominator</b> <strong>grows slower than double exponentials</strong>
    $$x_\alpha^{x_\alpha}.$$ 
    </li> 
    <ul>
      <li>Therefore, the probability of $x=x_\alpha$ given by the ratio,
      $$\frac{\mu^{x_\alpha}e^{-\mu}}{x_\alpha !}$$
      grows to a peak close to
      $$\frac{\mu^{\mu}e^{-\mu}}{\mu !}.$$</li>
      <li>For values $x_\alpha \geq \mu$, the denominator grows more quickly and becomes greater than the numerator;</li>
      <ul>
        <li>thus the <b>probability of $x=x_\alpha$</b> <strong>decreases for $x_\alpha \geq \mu$ but never reaches zero</strong>.</li>  
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>We can visualize this description in StatCrunch.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

========================================================

## Poisson distribution example

<ul>
  <li>Let's consider a simple example of how we can model a random proceedure with a Poisson distribution.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider our first example where we suppose that we have an expected value of $4$ pieces of mail per day with a standard deviation of $\sqrt{4}=2$ pieces of mail per day.</li>
    <li>We will suppose that:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>the expected number of pieces of mail does not change from day to day, and</li>
      <li>that the number of pieces of mail in any given day does not affect the number of pieces of mail in a different day.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If we want to find the probability of recieving exactly $x_\alpha = 6$ pieces of mail, this can be found as,
  $$\begin{align}
    P(x=x_\alpha) &= \frac{\mu^{x_\alpha}e^{-\mu}}{x_\alpha !} \\
    &= \frac{4^{6}e^{-4}}{6 !}.
    \end{align}$$
    </li>
    <li>This is a complicated expression, but one that we can look at directly in StatCrunch.</li>
</ul>

========================================================

### Poisson distribution example continued

<ul>
  <li>Let's consider another example of how we can use the Poisson distribution.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In the $55$ year period between $1960$ and $2015$ there have been $336$ Atlantic hurricanes.</li>
    <li>While the variation in the intensity of hurricanes changed over this period due to global climate change, the expected number of huricanes per year did not change.</li>
    <li>Also, the number of hurricanes in one year is basically independent of the number of hurricanes in a different year.</li>
    <li>Let's make the following assumptions:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>We will suppose that the Poisson distribution is a good model for the number of hurricanes in a year.</li>
      <li>We will suppose that the sample mean $\overline{x}$ is a good estimate for the expected value $\mu$ of the number of hurricanes per year.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Discuss with a neighbor:</b> can you identify the interval of interest for this problem, $x$ the random variable and $\overline{x}$ the sample mean?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The interval is the time period of one year.</li>
      <li>$x$ is the total number of hurricanes per year.</li>
      <li>$\overline{x} = \frac{336}{55} \approx 6.1$ hurricanes per year.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>We will consider now what the probability of $x=8$ hurricanes in one year.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the Poisson distribution, we say that
      $$P(x = 8) = \frac{(6.1)^8 e^{-6.1}}{8!}$$
      </li>
      <li>This is a complicated expression that we will look at in StatCrunch directly.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

========================================================

### Poisson distribution example continued

<ul>
  <li>We saw in StatCrunch that the probability of $x=8$ hurricanes in a year is,
  $$P(x = 8) = \frac{(6.1)^8 e^{-6.1}}{8!}\approx 10.7\%.$$</li>
  <li>This can be considered to say, we expect about $10$ or $11$ years with $8$ hurricanes in a $100$ year period.</li>
  <li><b>Note</b> in the $55$ year period there were exactly $5$ years which had precisely $8$ hurricanes in them.</li>
  <li><b>Discuss with a neighbor:</b> does the real outcome in terms of number of years with $8$ hurricanes seem to match our theoretical model with the Poisson distribution?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If we consider, $.107\times 55 =5.885$ then the $5$ years with $8$ hurricanes exactly appears to match this theoretical model for the number of hurricanes per year.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>This above example is a good introduction to the kind of thinkning we will start doing in this course:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We will have some ammount of <b style="color:#d95f02">sample data</b> and some knowledge about the way the <strong>random variable</strong> behaves.</li>
    <li>Our knowledge about the way the <b>random variable</b> behaves will suggest a theoretical model, a <strong>probability distribution</strong>, for this random variable.</li>
    <li>We will use our <b style="color:#d95f02">sample data</b> to try to <strong>estimate the relevant <b style="color:#1b9e77">parameters</b> of the distribution</strong>.</li>
    <li>We will then <b>test our theoretical model</b> versus data to <strong>validate it or invalidate it</strong>.</li>
    <li>Finally, what we have yet-to-do is to <b>provide an estimate</b> of <strong>how uncertain the parameters and the theoretical model are</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

========================================================

## Poisson distribution as an approximation for binomial distribution

<ul>
  <li>For theoretical reasons, the Poisson distribution is actually related to the binomial distribution.</li>
  <li>In certain cases, the <b>Poisson distribution</b> <strong>makes a good approximation of the binomial distribution</strong>.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the case generally when $n$ (the number of independent trials) is large; and $p$ (the probability of a successful trial) is small.</li> 
    <li>Specifically, our <b>approximation for binomial with Poisson</b> will require:</li>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>$n$ should be greater than $100$</strong>; and</li>
      <li><strong>$n\times p$ should be less than $10$</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
  <li>Recall that the <b style="color:#1b9e77">mean (expected value)</b> for the <b>binomial distribution</b> is given by, 
  $$\mu_b = n\times p .$$</li>
  <li>When the above two conditions are satisfied, we can <strong>approximate</strong> the <b style="color:#1b9e77">mean (expected value)</b> of the <b>Poisson distribution</b> by
  $$\mu_p \approx n \times p.$$</li>
  <li>We will consider an example of this with the Maine Pick 4 Game:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In this game you choose $4$ digits, each ranging between $0, 1, 2, \cdots, 9$.</li>
    <li>A winning number selected randomly -- i.e., each digit is selected randomly with equal probability and with replacement.</li>
    <li>Therefore, for our choice of number there is a probability of
    $$\frac{1}{10}\times \frac{1}{10}\times \frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{10,000}$$  
    that we are selected as a winner.</li>
    <li><b>Discuss with a neighbor:</b> if we play this game for $365$ days, can we model the probability of winning at least once with Poisson?</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

========================================================

## Poisson distribution as an approximation for binomial distribution continued

<ul>
  <li>From the last slide we know that there are $n=365$ trials and a probability of success $p=\frac{1}{10,000}$.</li>
  <li>Based on our conditions:</li>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>$n$ should be greater than $100$</strong>; and</li>
      <li><strong>$n\times p$ should be less than $10$</strong>;</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Poisson will make a good approximation here.</li>
  <li><b>Discuss with a neighbor:</b> to find the probability of <b>at least one success</b>, how can we use complementary probability to solve this problem?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Notice that $A=$"zero successes" implies $\overline{A}=$"at least one success".</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Using this fact, we can approximate the probability of $\overline{A}$ with the Poisson random variable $x$ as
  $$\begin{align}
  P(\overline{A}) &= 1 - P(A) \\
  &\approx 1 - P(x=0)\\
  &= 1 - \frac{ \left(n \times p\right)^0 \times e^{- n \times p}}{0!} \\
  &=1 - \frac{1 \times e^{- 0.0365}}{1} \approx 0.358.
  \end{align}$$</li>
  <li>In fact, using StatCrunch, we can see that the probability of at least $1$ success using the binomial distribution is also approximately $0.358$, so we get a good approximation here.</li> 
</ul>

========================================================

## Continuous random variables

<div style="float:left; width:35%;text-align:center;">

</p>
</div> 
<div style="float:left; width:65%">
<ul>
  <li>So far our examples have focused on <b>discrete random variables</b>, e.g.:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Results of <b>coin flips</b> -- $x$ is modeled with a <strong>binomial distribution</strong>.</li>
    <li>Results of <b>success / failure trials</b> -- $x$ is modeled with a <strong>binomial distribution</strong>.</li>
    <li>Number of <b>occurances in an interval</b> -- $x$ is modeled with a <strong>Poisson distribution</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>We will now turn our attention to <b>continuous random variables</b>, but we will use what we learned about <strong>discrete variables to motivate this</strong>.</li>
  <li>Recall that the probability histogram had the property,
    $$\begin{align}
  \text{Area of Rectangle }x_\alpha &= P(x=x_\alpha) \times 1\\ &= P(x=x_\alpha).
  \end{align}$$ 
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
  <li>We also saw that we have the property
  $$\sum_{x_\alpha \in \mathbf{R}} P(x=x_\alpha) =1. $$
  </li>
  <li>Putting the above two properties together, we know,
  $$\sum_{x_\alpha \in \mathbf{R}} \text{Area of Rectangle }x_\alpha =1.$$
  </li>
  <li>For <b>continuous random variables</b>, we in fact have the <strong>same property with a minor modification</strong>:
  <blockquote>
  Let $f(x)$ describe a curve for a probability distribution.  Then the total area under the curve $f(x)$ equals $1$, and the probability of any event $A$ equals the associated area under $f(x)$ for all $x_\alpha$ in the case of $A$.
  </blockquote>
</ul>

## Uniform distribution

<div style="float:left; width:65%;text-align:center;">

</p>
</div>  
<div style="float:left; width:35%">
<ul>
  <li>A basic example of the area property is with the <b>uniform distribution</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Let's suppose that we are studying some procedure where all outcomes are equally likely.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A very simple example is if you are asked to <b>guess a random number</b> between $1$ and $10$, <strong>but including decimals</strong>.</li> 
    </ul>
    <li>That is, we will suppose that guessing $1.23453453$ is equally likely as guessing $5$.</li> 
  </ul>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
  <li>Viewed in the above,
  <ul>
    <li>Our <b>random experiment</b> is <strong>guessing some number</strong>.</li>
    <li>The <b>outcome</b> is <strong>one guess</strong>.</li>
    <li>The <b>random variable $x$</b> is <strong>assigned the value of the guess</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Because we allow <b>arbitrary decimal expansions</b>, there are <strong>infinitely many choices</strong>.</li>   
  <li>However, <strong>all choices lie in the finite range $[1,10]$ and are equally likely</strong>.</li>
  <li><b>Discuss with a neighbor:</b> if the area under the curve $f(x)$ for $x_\alpha$ in $[1, 10]$ must equal one, and the height of $f(x)$ is constant, what is the height?</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Uniform distribution continued

</p>
</div>  
<div style="float:left; width:55%">
<ul>
  <li>Recall, the area is given by the height $h$ times the width $w$.</li>
  <li>The area is fixed at $1$ and the width is $10-1$ so that,
  $$\begin{align}
  &1 = h\times w \\
  \Leftrightarrow & \frac{1}{9} = h
  \end{align}$$</li>
  <li>Here, the probability distribution curve,
  $$
  f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  \frac{1}{9} & \text{for }x\text{ in }[1,10] \\
  0 & \text{else}
  \end{cases}
  $$
  <li>More generally, <strong>consider any range of values $[a,b]$</strong> where $a &lt; b$.</li>
  <li>If we can <strong>randomly select any value</strong> in the range $[a,b]$ with the <b>same likelihood</b></li>
  <li>let $x$ be the random variable assigned the value we select.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
  <li>Then the probability distribution for $x$ is <b>uniform over $[a,b]$</b>   with
  $$
    f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  \frac{1}{b-a} & \text{for }x\text{ in }[a,b] \\
  0 & \text{else}
  \end{cases}
  $$</li>
  <li>The <strong>graph of this distribution curve</strong> (as above) is called the <b>probability density</b>.</li>
  <li>Thus, if we take any $\alpha &lt; \beta$ in $[a, b]$, the probability of $x$ in $[\alpha, \beta]$ is given by the area (width times the height of this block),
  $$(\beta - \alpha) \times \frac{1}{b-a}.$$  </li>

  <li>We want to find the area under $f(x)$ defined as,
    $$  
      f(x) = 
      \begin{cases} 
      \frac{1}{5} & \text{for }x\text{ in }[0,5] \\
      0 & \text{else}
      \end{cases}
    $$</li>
  <li>but for the  interval between $2$ and $5$.</li>
  <li>The area can be derived as the length times height where,
  $$\begin{align}
  l = 5 - 2 = 3 & & h = 0.2 \text{ for }x\text{ in the range }[2,5]
  \end{align}$$</li>
  <li>That is,
  $$\begin{align}
  P(x \text{ in }[2, 5])  &= l \times h \\
  &= 3 \times 0.2 = 0.6
  \end{align}$$</li>
</ul>

  <li>Note that the <b>formula for the area</b>,
  $$\text{Area} = l \times h$$
  <strong>only applies for rectangles as above</strong>.</li>
  </li> 
  <li>However, the principle of,<br><br>
  $$\text{Probability } = \text{Area under the probability density graph}$$</br>
  <strong>holds for all distributions $f(x)$</strong>.</li> 
  <li>Particularly, this also holds for non-rectangular, <b>bell shaped curves</b>...</li>

  <li>Recall, frequency data is called normal when it exhibits the following:</li> 
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>The frequencies start low, then increase to one or two high frequencies, and
then decrease to a low frequency.</strong></li>
    <li> <strong>The distribution is approximately symmetric.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>There are few if any extreme values.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <li>We have a theoretical probability model for this type of data called a <b>normal distribution</b>.
  <li>Let <b>$x$ be a random variable</b> with <b style="color:#1b9e77">mean $\mu$</b> and <b style="color:#1b9e77">standard deviation $\sigma$</b> which behaves as above.</li>  
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
  <li>We say that $x$ has a <b>normal distribution</b>,
  $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x- \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}$$
  with <b style="color:#1b9e77">the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Note:</b> the area under $f(x)$ cannot be computed by $l\times h$, but the <strong>total area under the above curve is still $1$</strong>.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Therefore, <b>accurately computing the probability</b> of some event is typically <strong>done with computer methods</strong> -- like in StatCrunch.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>A special case of the normal distribution is the <b>standard normal distribution</b> with <b style="color:#1b9e77">mean $\mu =0$</b> and <b style="color:#1b9e77">standard deviation $\sigma=1$</b>,
    $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{\frac{1}{2}x^2}$$</li>
    <li>For the standard normal distribution as above, the <b>z-score</b> of some observation $x$ is actually just <strong>equal to $x$</strong>.</li>
