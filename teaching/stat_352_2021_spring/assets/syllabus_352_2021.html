<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Announcements and course updates will be posted in <a href="https://unr.canvaslms.com/login/canvas" target="blank">Webcampus</a>. Students are expected to keep up-to-date on the course by reading these announcements for important information on assignments, midterms, etc.</p>
<div id="health-and-safety-updates" class="section level3">
<h3>Health and safety updates</h3>
<p>The University of Nevada, Reno publishes it’s information for students including important policy updates and forms in <a href="https://www.unr.edu/coronavirus/students" target="blank">this page</a>. Students are expected to keep up-to-date with official communications from the university regarding health and safety, and university policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="pagebreak">
<div id="help-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Help &amp; Questions</h3>
<p>The best way to contact the instructor is via email or message within Webcampus. Messages received before 16:00 during business days will usually get a response the same day. Emails received after 16:00 or during the weekend are not guaranteed a same-day response. Longer questions will not be answered by email and will be directed to appointments or office hours.</p>
<p>The instructor will be <strong>available on Mondays and Wednesdays from 5:15 - 6:00 for public office hours and questions</strong>. If you cannot attend office hours or if you need to discuss something privately you can set an appointment with the instructor directly.</p>
</div>
<div id="netiquette" class="section level3">
<h3>Netiquette</h3>
<p>When communicating online, you should always:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Treat your instructor and peers with respect, even in email or in any other online communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Use clear and concise language. Be respective of readers’ time and attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that all college level communication should have correct spelling and grammar.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid slang terms and texting abbreviations.</p></li>
<li><p>Use standard fonts that are optimized for online reading (e.g., sans serif) along with a consistent and readable size (12 or 14 pt.)</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using the caps lock feature AS IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS YELLING.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit and possibly avoid the use of emoticons. Not everyone knows how to interpret them.</p></li>
<li><p>Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm as tone is sometimes lost in an email or written communication. Your message might be taken literally or offensively.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful sharing personal information online (both yours and other’s).</p></li>
<li><p>Always be respectful of others’ opinions even when they differ from your own. When you disagree with someone, you should express your differing opinion in a respectful, non-critical way. (Corollary: Do not make personal or insulting remarks.)</p></li>
<li><p>Be patient with yourself and others. Most people are facing unusual and difficult circumstances currently and everyone deserves some extra consideration.</p></li>

<div id="practice-quizzes" class="section level3">
<h3>Practice Quizzes</h3>
<p>The discussion sections will include practice quizzes in which you will be asked questions that will resemble the questions presented in our midterms. These quizzes are graded only for completion, and will be delivered by the teaching assistant with a discussion of their solution. They are meant to give you practice both with the content of the course and with the Canvas interface for the exams. You should treat these quizzes like they were real exams and use them as skill checks to see what areas you might need to improve on for the exams.</p>
</div>
<div class="pagebreak">
<div id="midterms" class="section level3">
<h3>Midterms</h3>
<p>Compliance with the university policy for student identity verification in online courses, we have proctored exams. In this course, you will be required to complete the first test using the remote proctoring service, Proctorio. Proctorio gives you the flexibility to schedule exams at your convenience and take them whenever you want within the exam availability window. Students will be required to show identification in order to enter the exam and allow for the recording of the testing area via webcam and microphone. More information on setting up your proctored exam with Proctorio will be provided later. Visit UNR’s <a href="https://www.unr.edu/tlt/instructional-design/instructional-technology-resources/online-test-proctoring">Proctorio webpage</a> to learn more about using Proctorio.</p>
<p>A standard scientific calculator and handwritten notes will be allowed on the exams. No other resources will be allowed on the exams and the user-session in Canvas will be monitored for leaving the exam window. Indications of using any electronic resources or communication with anyone but the instructor during the exams may be treated as a breach of the academic code of conduct.</p>

<h3><a id="exam_policy"></a> Final project policy</h3>
<p>The final project will involve solving problems in an R Markdown worksheet and submitting the worksheet with your work and your answers to a Canvas quiz. This project will be open-book, open-notes, but communication between a student an any other individual but the instructor about the project is prohibited. Any indications that a student has communicated about the project with anyone but the instructor may be treated as a breach of the academic code of conduct.</p>
