<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:
  * General hypothesis testing of the mean


========================================================
## General hypothesis testing of the mean

* When we studied confidence intervals, we differentiated how we could construct these in the case where the population variance was known or unknown.

* Particularly, we had to use the sample estimate for the standard error,
  
  $$\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
  in place of the true standard error in our calculations.
  
* Under the assumption that the random sample $X_i$ is normally distributed, we found that

  $$ T = \frac{X - \overline{x}}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$$
  is t distributed in $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
  
* Using the associated $t_\frac{\alpha}{2}$ critical value, we calculated the $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$ confidence interval as

  $$\left( \overline{x} - \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2} , \overline{x} + \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}\right).$$
  
* With the same development in the case $\sigma^2$ is known, we can replace the $z_\frac{\alpha}{2}$ and $z_\alpha$ critical values with t critical values to produce general hypothesis tests.

========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean

* Specifically, if we have a formal hypothesis test

  $$\begin{align}
  H_0:\mu = \tilde{\mu} & &
  H_1:  \mu \neq \tilde{\mu};
  \end{align}$$
  and if the variance $\sigma^2$ is also unknown;
  
* then assuming the null, we write the acceptance region as

   $$\left( \tilde{\mu} - \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2} , \tilde{\mu} + \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}\right).$$
   
* If the sample mean $\overline{X}$ lies outside of the acceptance region, i.e., in the critical region,

 $$\left(-\infty,  \tilde{\mu} - \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \cup \left( \tilde{\mu} + \hat{\sigma}_\overline{X} t_\frac{\alpha}{2}, \infty\right),$$
 
 * we reject the null hypothesis with $\alpha \times 100\%$ significance.
 
* Alternatively, if the sample mean lies within the acceptance region, we fail to reject the null hypothesis with $\alpha\times 100\%$ significance.

========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean

* We similarly will compute the P value in the case where $\sigma^2$ is unknown.

* Our test statistic will be the value,

  $$\begin{align}
  t_0 = \frac{\overline{X} - \tilde{\mu}}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}
  \end{align}$$
  
* Using the t distribution in $n-1$ degrees of freedom as our probability model, we calculate the probability of observing a value at least as extreme as $T_0$.

* If the P value falls below $\alpha$, we can reject the null hypothesis at $\alpha\times 100\%$ significance.

* This is how the `t.test()` function computes both the confidence interval and the hypothesis test simultaneously.

* In particular, it will assume a null hypothesis of $H_0: \mu = 0$ be default.

  * This default value is adjusted in the function keywords, along with the alternate hypothesis.
  
* We will now begin to consider how to use this function more generally.

========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* The sodium content of twenty 300-gram boxes of organic cornflakes was determined. 

* The data (in milligrams) are as follows:


```r
sodium_sample <- c(131.15, 130.69, 130.91, 129.54, 129.64, 128.77,130.72, 128.33, 128.24, 129.65, 130.14, 129.29, 128.71, 129.00, 129.39, 130.42, 129.53, 130.12, 129.78, 130.92)
```

* Let's suppose we want to test the hypothesis,

  $$\begin{align}
  H_0: \mu = 130 & & H_1:\mu \neq 130;
  \end{align}$$

* If we use `t.test()` directly, notice the output


```r
t.test(sodium_sample)
```

```

	One Sample t-test

data:  sodium_sample
t = 662.06, df = 19, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 129.3368 130.1572
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  129.747 
```

========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* Rather, to set the correct null and alternative hypothesis, we write,


```r
t.test(sodium_sample, mu=130, alternative="two.sided")
```

```

	One Sample t-test

data:  sodium_sample
t = -1.291, df = 19, p-value = 0.2122
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 130
95 percent confidence interval:
 129.3368 130.1572
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  129.747 
```

* Notice that the above includes the test statistic $t_0 = -1.291$.

  * This also lists the number of degrees of freedom $df= n-1 = 19$ for the t distribtion.
  
* Most importantly, this lists the P value, $\approx 0.2122$.

* If we take $\alpha=0.05$, a common convention, we say $P> \alpha$, such that <strong>we fail to reject the null hypothesis of $\mu = 130$</strong>.


========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* Suppose we wanted to perform a hypothesis test to make sure the mean sodium is not too high;

  * if we wanted to evaluate the one-sided hypothesis test

  $$\begin{align}
  H_0: \mu \leq 130 & & H_1:\mu >130,
  \end{align}$$
  
* we would write in R


```r
t.test(sodium_sample, mu=130, alternative="greater")
```

```

	One Sample t-test

data:  sodium_sample
t = -1.291, df = 19, p-value = 0.8939
alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 130
95 percent confidence interval:
 129.4081      Inf
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  129.747 
```

* Here, we once again fail to reject the null hypothesis at $\alpha\times 100\% = 5\%$ significance, as $P\approx 0.89$.

========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* Computing the power of a t test is about the same as if we were computing the power with a normal distribution, replacing the appropriate z / t critical values and probabilities as necessary.

* However, computing sample size necessary for a hypothesis test to reach a certain power is very complicated, and is much more easily done with technology.

* Moreover, there is a built-in feature in R that will compute either the power of a test, or the needed sample size to attain a power, with the t test.

* The `power.t.test()` takes the following arguments

```
power.t.test(n, delta, sd, sig.level, power, alternative, type="one.sample")
```

* where 
  * `n` is the sample size
  * `delta` is the difference between the assumed, but untrue, null hypothesis and the unknown, but assumed true, alternative hypothesis;
  * `sd` is the the sample standard deviation;
  * `sig.level` is the value of $\alpha$;
  * `power` is the power of the test;
  * `alternative` is the alternative hypothesis; and
  * we need to specify the `type="one.sample"` as above.


========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* When we enter the `power.t.test()`,

```
power.t.test(n, delta, sd, sig.level, power, alternative, type="one.sample")
```

* we will  actually leave out one of `power` or  `n` out as an argument.

* The argument that is left out, `power` or `n`, will be computed from the other arguments.

* We will continue our example with the sodium sample, now evaluating the power of our earlier tests


```r
t.test(sodium_sample, mu=130, alternative="two.sided")
```

```

	One Sample t-test

data:  sodium_sample
t = -1.291, df = 19, p-value = 0.2122
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 130
95 percent confidence interval:
 129.3368 130.1572
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  129.747 
```
  
========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* In our sodium sample example, we had


```r
s <- sd(sodium_sample)
n <- length(sodium_sample)
mu_null <- 130.0
```

* Suppose we have a specific value for the alternative hypothesis in mind, i.e., 


```r
mu_alternative <- 130.5
```


* and we wish to determine the power of the test to reject the false, null hypothesis.

* We will leave the `power` argument blank in the function, but we need to calculate `delta`.

* `delta` is given as the absolute difference between our false null hypothesis, and the true alternative, i.e.,


```r
delta <- abs(mu_null - mu_alternative)
delta
```

```
[1] 0.5
```



========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* To calculate the power of the hypothesis test,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  H_0 : \mu = 130 & & H_1:\mu \neq 130
  \end{align}$$

* where we assume the true alternative hypothesis is $H_1: \mu=130.5$,

* with a significance level of $\alpha=0.05$,

* we can compute this at once witht the `power.t.test()` as:


```r
power.t.test(n=n, delta=delta, sd=s, sig.level=0.05, power=NULL, type="one.sample")
```

```

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 20
          delta = 0.5
             sd = 0.8764288
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.6775708
    alternative = two.sided
```



========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples


* Suppose we want to calculate power of the same type of hypothesis test, but with a different, one-sided alternative hypothesis.

  * e.g., 
  
  $$\begin{align}
  H_0:\mu \leq 130 & & H_1 :\mu > 130.
  \end{align}$$
  
* We specify this in the function as,


```r
power.t.test(n=n, delta=delta, sd=s, alternative="one.sided" , sig.level=0.05, power=NULL, type="one.sample")
```

```

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 20
          delta = 0.5
             sd = 0.8764288
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.7921742
    alternative = one.sided
```

========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* On the other hand, suppose we need to find the sample size necessary to meet a certain power with one of the earlier hypothesis tests.

* E.g., we might try to reject the null if a true mean sodium content is actually 130.1 milligrams, with a power of the test equal to 0.75.

* To do so, we now need to negelct the sample size argument `n` and supply the power argument `power`.

* The needed arguments are assigned below:


```r
s <- sd(sodium_sample)
mu_null <- 130.0
mu_alternative <- 130.1
delta <- abs(mu_null - mu_alternative)
pow <- 0.75
```


========================================================
### General hypothesis testing of the mean -- examples

* We determine the appropriate sample size via


```r
power.t.test(n=NULL, delta=delta, sd=s, power=pow, type="one.sample")
```

```

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 535.0307
          delta = 0.1
             sd = 0.8764288
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.75
    alternative = two.sided
```

* for the two-sided test, or for the one-sided test we use


```r
power.t.test(n=NULL, delta=delta, sd=s, alternative="one.sided", power=pow, type="one.sample")
```

```

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 414.5589
          delta = 0.1
             sd = 0.8764288
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.75
    alternative = one.sided
```

========================================================
## Summary

* This covers all the standard tools for general hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for the mean;

  * the last homework exercises and the final project questions can be solved with these tools.
  
* Other hypothesis tests, such as a test on the standard deviation,

$$\begin{align}
H_0 :\sigma = \tilde{\sigma} & & H_1: \sigma \neq \tilde{\sigma}
\end{align}$$
 can be performed very similarly in R, using built-in functions.
 
* For further hypothesis testing in the future, you are recommended to search the appropriate R documentation for how to use these functions.

* The interpretations of the P value, level of significance, power of the test will all translate;

  * however, the specific distribution / test statistic will change in general.
  
* However, the test statistic, P value and power are all computed "under-the-hood" and it is more important that you can comfortably interpret these outputs.

* The objective for this course was to give all students a working toolbox for standard statistical analysis and inference.

* Specifically, we learned the underlying theory of statistical inference, and how to make such an analysis in the modern environment of R Markdown.

* Everyone is encouraged to continue building their skills in this framework;
  
  * for a more detailed class on statistical computation, consider STAT 445 in the fall.
