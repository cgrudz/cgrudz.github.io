========================================================

## Review of main concepts

* For a continuous random variable, the concepts from discrete random variables have direct analogs.

* We have the following correspondences

* Due to the difference between discrete measurements and continuous measurements (where we can arbitrarily sub-divide units) <strong>the probability of measuring a single value of a continuous random variable always has probability zero</strong>.

* Particularly, with continuous random variables, we always define probabilities over ranges of values, assuming some kind of truncation approximation.

* Otherwise the ideas are extremely similar by replacing sums with integrals (or Riemann sums).

* We will now consider two very common continuous probability distributions.

========================================================

## Continuous uniform disribution

* Let's recall the copper current example from the last lecture. 

* The random variable $X$ has a probability density defined as
  
  $$\begin{align}
  f(x) = \begin{cases}
  5.0 & x\in[4.9, 5.1]\\
  0.0 & \text{else}
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}$$</li>
  
* Similarly we found that the cumulative distribution function is given by

  $$\begin{align}
  F(x)&= \begin{cases}
       0.0 & x \in(-\infty, 4.9)\\
       5.0\left(x - 4.9\right) & x \in[4.9, 5.1]\\
       1.0 & x \in (5.1,\infty)
       \end{cases}
  \end{align}$$

* The above is actually a specific example of the general continuous uniform probability distribution.

* The continuous uniform is the probability model for a continuous random variable in which we assign <b>equal probability</b> to any <strong>sub-interval of equal length that lies in the range</strong>.

* For example, in the above, we can see that 
  
  $$\begin{align}
  P(X\in [4.9,5.0]) = 0.5; & &
  P(X\in [5.0,5.1]) = 0.5.
  \end{align}$$

* More generally, a simple $\text{height}\times \text{width}$ area argument shows that for any $a,b\in[4.9,5.1]$,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  b-a=0.1 & & \Rightarrow & & P(X\in[a,b]) = 0.5.
  \end{align}$$

========================================================

### Continuous uniform disribution continued
<div style="float:left; width:65%">
<ul>
  <li>More generally we have the general form of the continuous uniform distribution given as follows.</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;"><blockquote>Let $b>a$ be real numbers. A continuous random variable $X$ with the probability density function
  $$\begin{align}
  f(x) = 
  \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{b-a} & x \in[a,b]\\
  0 & \text{else}
  \end{cases}\end{align}$$
  is a <b>continuous uniform random variable</b>.
  </blockquote></li>
  <li>Notice that the above construction guarantees that the area under the density curve is exactly equal to one -- the graph is pictured right.</li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
  <li>I.e., the area is compatible with our understanding of the total probability being equal to one:
  $$\begin{align}
  \text{height}\times\text{width} = \frac{1}{b-a}\times \left(b-a\right) = 1
  \end{align}$$</li>
  <li>We often denote the range $[a,b]$ as the <b>support of the distribution</b>, i.e., the <strong>range in which the density is non-zero</strong>.
  <li>Outside of the range $[a,b]$, we say that there is no support for the probability as the probability of $X$ lying outside of the range $[a,b]$ is always zero.</li>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================

### Continuous uniform disribution continued

* The simple form of the continuous uniform distribution makes it easy to compute some key parameters.

* For example,

  $$\begin{align}
  \mu &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty xf(x) \mathrm{d}x \\
      &= \int_{a}^b \frac{x}{b-a} \mathrm{d}x \\
      &= \frac{x^2}{2(b-a)}\big\vert_{a}^b\\
      &= \frac{b^2 - a^2}{2(b-a)}
  \end{align}$$
  
* But recall that we can factor
  
  $$b^2 - a^2 = (b+a)(b-a)$$
  such that
  
  $$\mu = \frac{b+a}{2}.$$
  
* This corresponds once again to that the mean or expected value is the center of mass / average of the endpoints.

========================================================

### Continuous uniform disribution continued

* Noting that $\mu=\frac{b+a}{2}$, we can similarly obtain the variance as

  $$\begin{align}
  \sigma^2 &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - \mu)^2 f(x)\mathrm{d}x \\
  &= \int_{a}^b \frac{\left(x - \frac{b+a}{2}\right)^2}{b-a}\mathrm{d}x \\
  \end{align}$$
  
* Recall, we can make a substitution as $u = x - \frac{b+a}{2}$ such that $du=dx$ and the range of integration is adjusted as

  $$\begin{align}
  u_\text{lower} =  a - \frac{b+a}{2} = \frac{a - b}{2}& & 
  u_\text{upper} =  b - \frac{b+a}{2} = \frac{b-a}{2}
  \end{align}$$
  
* This results in,

  $$\begin{align}
  \sigma^2 = \int_{\frac{a-b}{2}}^{\frac{b-a}{2}} \frac{u^2}{b-a}\mathrm{d}u = \frac{u^3}{3(b-a)}\big\vert_\frac{a-b}{2}^\frac{b-a}{2}
  \end{align}$$
  
* Notice that the cubic term has the property that $-(a-b)^3 = (b-a)^3$, such that
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \sigma^2 &= \frac{(b-a)^3}{8\times3(b-a)}  - \frac{(a-b)^3}{8\times3(b-a)} = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}
  \end{align}$$

========================================================

### Continuous uniform disribution continued

* Finally, we can generally compute the cumulative distribution function of the continuous uniform as

  $$\begin{align}
  F(x) &= \int_{a}^x \frac{1}{b-a} \mathrm{d}u  \\
       &= \frac{u}{b-a} \big\vert_{a}^x  \\
       &= \frac{x - a}{b-a}
  \end{align}$$
  where $x \in[a,b]$.
  
* Therefore, the general form is
  
  $$\begin{align}
  F(x) = 
  \begin{cases}
  0 & x \in(-\infty, a) \\
  \frac{x-a}{b-a} & x \in [a,b]\\
  1 & x \in [b,\infty)
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}$$

## The normal distribution

</p>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:60%">
<ul>
 <li>The most widely used model for a continuous measurement is a <b>normal random variable</b>. 
 <li>Whenever a random experiment is replicated, the <strong>average result over the replicates</strong> tends to have a <b>normal distribution</b> as the number of replicates becomes large.</li>
 <li>De Moivre presented this fundamental result, known as the central limit theorem, in 1733.</li>
 <li>Unfortunately this was lost for some time, and Gauss independently developed a normal distribution 100 years later.</li>
 <li>Although De Moivre was later credited with the derivation, a normal distribution is also referred to as a Gaussian distribution.</li>
 <li>The <b>central limit theorem</b> is the basis for <strong>classical statistical inference</strong>.</li> 
 <li>Using this, we can use this model to <b style="color:#1b9e77">infer general properties of a population</b> from <b style="color:#d95f02">representative samples</b>.</li>
 <li>For example, an automotive engineer may plan a study to average pull-off force measurements from several connectors.</li>
 <li>If we assume that each measurement results from a replicate of a random experiment,</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
 <li>then, the normal distribution can be used to make approximate conclusions about the average pulloff force for all connectors of this design.</li>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================

### The normal distribution continued

* Furthermore, sometimes the central limit theorem is less obvious. 

* For example, assume that the deviation (or error) in the length of a machined part is the sum of a large number
of infinitesimal effects, e.g., 

  * such as temperature and humidity drifts, 
  * vibrations, 
  * cutting angle variations, 
  * cutting tool wear, 
  * bearing wear, 
  * rotational speed variations, 
  * mounting and fixture variations, 
  * variations in numerous raw material characteristics, and 
  * variations in levels of contamination. 
  
* If the component errors are independent and equally likely to be positive or
negative, the total error can be shown to have an <b>approximate normal distribution</b>. 

* Furthermore, the normal distribution arises in the study of numerous basic physical phenomena. 

* For example, physicist James Maxwell developed a normal distribution from simple assumptions regarding the velocities of molecules.

<ul>
  <li>Unlike how we defined the density and used this to compute $\mu$ and $\sigma$ for the uniform, we will reverse this for the normal.</li>
  <li>That is, we will use $\mu$ and $\sigma$ to define the density of the normal and <strong>parametrize the distribution</strong>.</li>
  <li> Let us use the following notation for compactness where
    $$\exp(x) = e^{x}.$$</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:none;"><blockquote>Let the <b>normal random variable</b> $X$ have mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. The probability density function is given as

  </blockquote></li>
  <li>Recall how we considered $\mu$ to be a measure of center and $\sigma$ a measure of spread.</li>
  <li>If we vary these two values, we can change the center of mass and the spread of the normal distribution:</li>

<ul>
  <li>the empirical rule tells us that the probability becomes extremely small beyond three standard deviations from the mean.</li>
  <li>In particular:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>$\approx 68\%$ of the population lies within one standard deviation of the mean, $[\mu - \sigma, \mu+\sigma]$;</li>
    <li>$\approx 95\%$ of the population lies within two standard deviations of the mean, $[\mu - 2 \sigma , \mu + 2 \sigma]$</li>

<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
  <li>We can understand this by the form of the Gaussian density equation, where the term
  $$\begin{align}
  \exp\left(-\frac{\left(x - \mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  shrinks at a super-exponential rate as $x$ deviates from $\mu$, relative to the size of $\sigma$.</li>
  <li>This has a limiting property where
  $$\lim_{x \rightarrow \pm \infty} \exp\left(-\frac{\left(x - \mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) = 0$$
  but this is positive for any finite value $x$.</li>
</ul>
</div>

========================================================

## The standard normal distribution

* A special normal distribution that is commonly used for calculations is the <b>standard normal</b>.

  <li style="list-style-type:none;"><blockquote>The <b>standard normal random variable</b> $Z$ has mean $\mu=0$ and standard deviation $\sigma=1$. The probability density function is therefore given as
  $$\begin{align}
  f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{z^2}{2}\right).
  \end{align}$$
  We denote the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal $\Phi(z)=P(Z\leq z)$.
  </blockquote></li>

* The primary reason that the standard normal is often used in practice is because of the following result:


  <li style="list-style-type:none;"><blockquote>Let the <b>normal random variable</b> $X$ have mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. The random variable defined
  $$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$
  <strong>follows the standard normal distribution above</strong>.
  </blockquote></li>

* This says that for <b>any normal random variable</b> $X$, if we shift the center to zero $X - \mu$;
  
* and re-scale the spread to one

  $$ Z=\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma};$$
  
* <strong>we can model the population with the easier-to-compute standard normal</strong>.

========================================================

### The standard normal distribution continued

* The previous technique is known as <b>standardizing a normal variable</b>.

* Because it is simple to standardize a variable, this technique was widely used before computers to calculate normal probabilities.

* Specifically, if one has a normal model for the population $X$ with mean $\mu$ and $\sigma$, this says,

  $$\begin{align}
  X \leq x &&\Leftrightarrow && X - \mu \leq x - \mu && \Leftrightarrow && \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \leq \frac{x -\mu}{\sigma} & & Z \leq z
  \end{align}$$
  
* Therefore,

  $$\begin{align}
  P(X\leq x) = P(Z\leq z) 
  \end{align}$$
  and this holds for all other ranges.
  
* Note, this argument doesn't work for every distribution.

* It is a special property of the normal that we can <strong>shift the center and scale the spread and the distribution remains normal</strong>.

* This is one of several very special properties of this model.

========================================================

### The standard normal distribution continued

* Because we standardize normal variables, the standard normal table for "z-scores" is a long used tool in statistics.

* Rather than compute the probability for every normal variable individually, traditional statistics used a table for the standard normal to compute probabilities by standardizing the general normal variable.

<li style="list-style-type:none;"><blockquote>Let $x$ be a measurement of a <b>normal random variable</b> $X$, which has mean $\mu=0$ and standard deviation $\sigma=1$. The <b>z-score</b> of the measurement is
  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{z-\mu}{\sigma}
  \end{align}$$
  which <strong>measures how many standard deviations</strong> $\sigma$ the measurement lies from the mean $\mu$ in the positive or negative direction.
  </blockquote></li>

* For our homework and the second midterm, we will practice the traditional approach using z-scores.

* However, after the second midterm, we will focus on the modern approach using computer languages to make all such calculations.

========================================================

## Computing z-scores from tables

<div style="float:left; width:50%">
<ul>
  <li>To the right is a traditional z-score table.</li>
  <li>In the rows, we can find a $z$ value to the tenth decimal place.</li>
  <li>In the columns, we can add values to the hundredth decimal place.</li>
  <li>For example, if we want to compute the value
  $$P(Z\leq 0.12)$$
  this value can be found precisely in <b>first row</b> and <b>third column</b>.</li>
  <li>For an arbitrary value $z$, we can thus compute the probability
  $$P(Z\leq z)$$
  by finding a close approximation $\tilde{z}\approx z$ up to rounding error and take the value in the table.</li>
  <li>For an arbitrary range of values $z_1 \leq Z \leq z_2$, we can find $\tilde{z}_1 \approx z_1$ and $\tilde{z}_2 \approx z_2$ as above and find the probability as
  $$\begin{align}
  P(z_1 \leq Z\leq z_2) &= P(Z\leq z_2) - P(Z\leq z_1) \\
  &\approx P(Z\leq \tilde{z}_2) - P(Z\leq \tilde{z}_1)
  \end{align}$$
  </li>
  <li>The calculation then just requires finding the values $P(Z\leq \tilde{z}_2)$ and $P(Z\leq \tilde{z}_1)$ in the appropriate row and column of the table.</li>
