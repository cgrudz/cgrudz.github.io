<h2>Health and safefty updates</h2>
<p>The latest guidelines addressing COVID 19 topic, including face covering, social distancing, contact tracing, and testing, are available on the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/coronavirus">UNR Coronavirus website</a>. The website also includes section that addresses many frequently asked questions regarding COVID 19 vaccinations and what to do regarding positive tests and close encounters.</p>
</div>
<div id="face-coverings-required-for-in-person-attendance" class="section level2">
<h2>Face Coverings Required for In-person Attendance</h2>
<p>In response to COVID-19, and in alignment local, state, and U.S. Center for Disease Control guidelines, face coverings are required at all times in all University indoor public spaces, including classroom, laboratory, studio, creative space, or any type of in-person instructional activity, and public spaces. Furthermore, individuals who have not been fully vaccinated against COVID 19 are required to wear a face covering at all times while on campus, including all indoor and outdoor public spaces.</p>
<p>A “face covering” is defined as a “covering that fully covers a person’s nose and mouth, including without limitation, cloth face mask, surgical mask, towels, scarves, and bandanas” (State of Nevada Emergency Directive 024).</p>
</div>
<div id="vaccination" class="section level2">
<h2>Vaccination</h2>
<p>
Anyone 12 and older is eligible to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, and anyone 18 and older is eligible to receive the Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. There are multiple locations in the community offering free vaccination. Vaccinations and testing are also available for free at the <a href="/coronavirus/testing">Student Health Center</a> for students, faculty and staff.

<div id="help-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Help &amp; Questions</h3>
<p>There will be a classroom discussion forum where you can seek help from the instructor and peers about the assignments. Some assignments will require that you post and discuss results in this forum.</p>
<p>The best way to contact the instructor is via email or message within Canvas. Messages received before 4:00 PM during business days will usually get a response the same day. Emails received after 4:00 PM or during the weekend are not guaranteed a same-day response. Longer questions will not be answered by email and will be directed to appointments or office hours.</p>
<p>The instructor will be <strong>available from 4:00 - 5:30 PM MonWed for public office hours and questions, shared with students from STAT 445 / 645</strong>. If you cannot attend office hours or if you need to discuss something privately you can set an appointment with the instructor directly.</p>
</div>
<div id="netiquette" class="section level3">
<h3>Netiquette</h3>
<p>When communicating online, you should always:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Treat your instructor and peers with respect, even in email or in any other online communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Use clear and concise language. Be respective of readers’ time and attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that all college level communication should have correct spelling and grammar.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid slang terms and texting abbreviations.</p></li>
<li><p>Use standard fonts that are optimized for online reading (e.g., sans serif) along with a consistent and readable size (12 or 14 pt.)</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using the caps lock feature AS IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS YELLING.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit and possibly avoid the use of emoticons. Not everyone knows how to interpret them.</p></li>
<li><p>Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm as tone is sometimes lost in an email or discussion post and your message might be taken literally or offensively.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful sharing personal information online (both yours and other’s).</p></li>
<li><p>Always give proper credit when referencing or quoting another source. (Corollary: Don’t copy and paste another student’s post and claim it as original as that is essentially plagiarism.)</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t repeat someone else’s post without adding something of your own to it. (See corollary above regarding reuse of someone else’s post.)</p></li>
<li><p>Always be respectful of others’ opinions even when they differ from your own. When you disagree with someone, you should express your differing opinion in a respectful, non-critical way. (Corollary: Do not make personal or insulting remarks.)</p></li>

<h2>Course description</h2>
<div id="content" class="section level3">
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>Data assimilation (DA) refers to techniques used to combine the data from physics-based, numerical models and real-world observations to produce an estimate for the state of a time-evolving random process and the parameters that govern its evolution. Owing to their history in numerical weather prediction, DA systems are designed to operate in an extremely large dimension of model variables and observations, often with sequential-in-time observational data. As a long-studied “big-data” problem, DA has benefited from the fusion of a variety of techniques, including methods from Bayesian inference, dynamical systems, numerical analysis, optimization, control theory and machine learning. DA techniques are widely used in many areas of geosciences, neurosciences, biology, autonomous vehicle guidance and various engineering applications requiring dynamic state estimation and control.</p>
<p>After introducing students to essential elements of linear estimation theory, this course will focus on the development and application of operational, statistical learning algorithms in nonlinear, physics-based models. The course will rely on the Python programming language for many exercises and for the final project, with the DAPPER library providing a framework for the class. The DAPPER library is suitable for small- to mid-scale DA and uncertainty quantification research and provides a pedagogical stepping stone for students to high-performance libraries and / or writing their own solvers. Students do not need to know Python programming in advance, but some familiarity with programming and computation generally will be beneficial. <a href="#final_exam_policy">final exam policy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-for-online-learning" class="section level3">
<h3>Structure for online learning</h3>
<p>This class will follow a flipped design in which students are expected to watch one or more short lectures before the class session. <strong>If a student is unable to or would prefer not to attend in-person, a HyFlex remote learning option will be granted.</strong> Video lectures will cover content that is relevant to the day’s activity in class. Class sessions will be held on Zoom and students are expected to attend the Zoom meeting to work on the day’s activities with their cohort. Students should have a laptop for working through activities during class in-person class in the Python programming language, or should be able to attend remotely with a computer that will accommodate this. Each week will require posting a discussion of about the results in the week’s activities. Programming experience in Python is not required and there will be bi-weekly assignments in DataCamp that will build on fundamental skills in the Python scientific programming environment.</p>

<h2>Late policy and exceptions</h2>
<p>There are no makeups for participation assignments, DataCamp assignments or the final term paper except for university recognized activities or exceptional circumstances, as per university policy. To accommodate unforeseen circumstances, <strong>the lowest DataCamp score and the lowest two participation scores will be dropped from the final grade calculation</strong>. If a student needs to miss class due to participation in official university activities or a religious observance, they <strong>must make arrangements with the instructor at least one week prior to the date in question – the absence will not be given consideration without this advanced notice</strong>. In cases of absences due to extended illness, family emergency, bereavement, or other compelling reason, students should notify the instructor as soon as possible and <strong>within one week of the start of the absence</strong>. The instructor has the right to request formal, written documentation in such cases as they deem appropriate.
