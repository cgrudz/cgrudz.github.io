<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:
  * 3D-VAR
  * 3D-VAR versus the extended Kalman filter
  * The extended Kalman filter

========================================================
## Motivation

* While <b style="color:#d95f02">pure Bayesian techniques</b> such as the <strong>particle filter</strong> and <strong>Metropolis-Hastings</strong> are theoretically capable of fully nonlinear / non-Gaussian estimation, i.e., in systems like

  $$\begin{align}
  \pmb{x}_k &= \mathcal{M}_k (\pmb{x}_{k-1}) + \pmb{w}_k \\
  \pmb{y}_k &= \mathcal{H}_k (\pmb{x}_k) + \pmb{v}_k
  \end{align}$$
  with <strong>arbitrary error distributions</strong>,</li>

  * in practice, for systems of even <b>moderately large dimension</b>, these approaches can become <b style="color:#d95f02">computationally intractable</b>.
  
* Particle filters and similar methods are currently an active research area, with a variety of techniques being developed to overcome the curse of dimensionality.

  * Currently, however, this computational barrier has hindered their operational use in large-scale prediction problems.

* For the rest of the course, we will consider a variety of ways that tools from the  <b style="color:#1b9e77">linear-Gaussian estimation problem</b> can be <strong>adapted for prediction algorithms that can be used at-scale</strong>.

========================================================
## Motivation

* <b>3D-VAR</b> and the <b>extended Kalman filter</b> are two closely related approaches for  <b style="color:#1b9e77">extending the linear-Gaussian intuition</b> to large-scale estimation problems.

* While 3D-VAR is not widely used currently in large-scale operational prediction problems,

  * and while the extended Kalman filter has only seen limited implementation for large-scale operational prediction,
  
* these two approaches are <strong>foundational for understanding the challenges and the methods</strong> devised for  <b style="color:#1b9e77">large-scale nonlinear estimation</b>.

* Likewise, <b>3D-VAR</b> forms an important component in understanding a variety of modern techniques such as <strong>covariance hybridization</strong>.

* For these reasons, we will provide a general, high-level discussion of these methods.

========================================================
## 3D-VAR

* Let us recall the form of the <b>penalized, state-space objective function</b> that we derived in <strong>least-squares optimization</strong>:

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathcal{J}_p(\pmb{x}) := \frac{1}{2} \parallel \pmb{x} - \overline{\pmb{x}}\parallel_{\mathbf{B}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \parallel \pmb{y} - \mathbf{H}\pmb{x}\parallel_{\mathbf{R}_k}^2.
  \end{align}$$

* where, like in the  <b style="color:#1b9e77">Gaussian maximum a posteriori estimation</b>, we estimate an optimal state as a <b>balance between</b>:

  <ol>
    <li>the <strong>deviation from the background estimate</strong>, weighted inverse proportionally to the uncertainty weights $\mathbf{B}$; and</li>
    <li>the <strong>deviation from the observed data</strong>, weighted inverse proportionally to the uncertainty of the data $\mathbf{R}_k$.</li> 
  </ol>
  
* The method of <b>3D-VAR</b> is to extend this objective function directly to nonlinear dynamics where we may  <b style="color:#1b9e77">replace $\mathbf{H}$ with a nonlinear map $\mathcal{H}$</b>.

* The objective function therefore becomes

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathcal{J}_p(\pmb{x}) := \frac{1}{2} \parallel \pmb{x} - \overline{\pmb{x}}\parallel_{\mathbf{B}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \parallel \pmb{y} - \mathcal{H}(\pmb{x})\parallel_{\mathbf{R}_k}^2,
  \end{align}$$
  which is no <b>longer guaranteed to be globally convex</b>, and therefore <strong>must be locally minimized</strong>.
  
* This can be performed with, e.g., a Gauss-Newton or other quasi-Newton procedures for the minimization;

  * the optimized state estimate $\hat{\pmb{x}}$ can thus be propagated to find a subsequent forecast.

* However, in the nonlinear setting, there are a variety of new considerations for how this optimization compares to the "optimal" Bayesian solution.

========================================================
### 3D-VAR

* Specifically, the <strong>selection and interpretation</strong> of the <b>background covariance / weights matrix</b> $\mathbf{B}$ changes considerably.

  * Likewise, the <strong>interpretation of the optimized solution</strong> $\hat{\pmb{x}}$ <b>depends on the background</b>.
  
* In 3D-VAR, the typical choice of the background weights $\mathbf{B}$ is given by taking the <b style="color:#1b9e77">covariance matrix for the model state</b> over a <strong>long time series of past observations / model simulations</strong>.

* In weather and climate prediction, this is known as the "climatological covariance", estimated over a long past record of the state variables.

* This has the benefit that this gives a <b>cost effective analysis</b>, as the background is taken as $\mathbf{B}_k \equiv \mathbf{B}$ <strong>static-in-time</strong>.

* Similarly, the initial guess $\overline{\pmb{x}}$ is given by the model simulation of the last optimized solution $\hat{\pmb{x}}$,
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \overline{\pmb{x}} := \mathcal{M}_k \left(\hat{\pmb{x}}\right).
  \end{align}$$

* This is understood then to <b style="color:#1b9e77">optimize the last forecast solution versus the observed data</b>, where the <strong>background is using "static persistence weights"</strong>.

* That is, the static persistence weights do not include the information of the time-evolving covariance, only the long-time static information about the variables.

* If we suppose that $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{R}_k$ are selected accurately, and the long-time distribution for $\pmb{x}$ is Gaussian, this can be interpreted as the <b style="color:#1b9e77">maximum-a-posteriori estimate from the invariant distribution of the dynamics</b>.

========================================================
### 3D-VAR versus the extended Kalman filter

* The primary benefit of the <b>3D-VAR</b> approach is its <strong>simplicity in the estimation problem</strong>.

  * However, this is also the <b>primary weakness</b>, as by not considering the time-varying covariance of the forecast,
  
  * this <strong>lacks information about the time-varying evolution of the state</strong>.

* The <b>extended Kalman filter</b> seeks to rectify this by explicitly constructing a procedure to produce a time-varying background as with the Kalman filter.

* This is performed by using the <b style="color:#1b9e77">tangent-linear model for Gaussian perturbations of the mean state</b>.


========================================================
## The extended Kalman filter

* In particular, suppose that the equations of motion are generated by a nonlinear function, independent of time for simplicity,

  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \pmb{x} = \pmb{f}(\pmb{x}) & &\pmb{x}_k= \mathcal{M}_k(\pmb{x}_{k-1}):= \int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} \pmb{f}(\pmb{x}) \mathrm{d}t + \pmb{x}_{k-1}
  \end{align}$$

* We can <b>extend the linear-Gaussian approximation</b> for the forecast density as

  $$\begin{align}
  &\pmb{x}_{k-1} := \overline{\pmb{x}}_{k-1} + \pmb{\delta}_{k-1} \sim   N(\overline{\pmb{x}}_{k-1}, \mathbf{B}_{k-1})\\
\Leftrightarrow  &\pmb{\delta}_{k-1} \sim N(\pmb{0}, \mathbf{B}_{k-1})
\end{align}$$

* The evolution of the perturbation $\pmb{\delta}$ can thus be <strong>approximated via Taylor's theorem</strong> as

  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \pmb{\delta}&:= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\left( \pmb{x} - \overline{\pmb{x}}\right)\\
  &=\pmb{f}(\pmb{x}) - \pmb{f}(\overline{\pmb{x}})\\
  &=\nabla_{\pmb{x}}\pmb{f}(\overline{\pmb{x}})\pmb{\delta} + \mathcal{O}\left(\parallel \pmb{\delta}\parallel^2\right)
  \end{align}$$
  where $\nabla_{\pmb{x}}\pmb{f}(\overline{\pmb{x}})$ is the <b>Jacobian equation</b> with <strong>dependence on the underlying mean state</strong>.

* In particular, the linear evolution defined by the truncated Taylor expansion

  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \pmb{\delta}:= \nabla_{\pmb{x}}\pmb{f}(\overline{\pmb{x}})\pmb{\delta}
  \end{align}$$
  is known as the <b>tangent-linear model</b>.

========================================================
### The extended Kalman filter

* Making the approximation of the tangent-linear model,

  $$\begin{align}
  &\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \pmb{x} \approx \pmb{f}(\overline{\pmb{x}}) + \nabla_{\pmb{x}}\pmb{f}(\overline{\pmb{x}})\pmb{\delta}\\ \\
  \Rightarrow&\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\pmb{x}\mathrm{d}t \approx  \int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} \pmb{f}(\overline{\pmb{x}}) \mathrm{d}t + \int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k}\nabla_{\pmb{x}}\pmb{f}(\overline{\pmb{x}})\pmb{\delta}\mathrm{d}t \\ \\
  \Rightarrow & \pmb{x}_{k} \approx \mathcal{M}_{k}\left(\overline{\pmb{x}}_{k-1}\right) + \mathbf{M}_k\pmb{\delta}_{k-1}
  \end{align}$$
  where $\mathbf{M}_k$ is the <b>resolvent of the tangent-linear model</b>.
  
* <strong>Gaussians are closed under affine transformations</strong>, approximating the evolution under the tangent-linear model as

  $$\begin{align}
  \pmb{x}_{k} \sim N\left(\mathcal{M}_k\left(\overline{\pmb{x}}_{k-1}\right), \mathbf{M}_k \mathbf{B}_{k-1}\mathbf{M}^\top_{k}\right)
  \end{align}$$

* Therefore, this provides a means, in principle, to approximate the evolution of the background covariance in time.

========================================================
### The extended Kalman filter

* The <b>extended Kalman filter</b> can be understood then as turning the 3D-VAR objective function into a <strong>time-varying objective function</strong> as follows.

* Let the previous analysis solution be given by <b>approximating the distribution of the model state</b> as

  $$\begin{align}
  \pmb{x}_k &\sim N\left(\overline{\pmb{x}}^{\mathrm{filt}}_{k-1} , \mathbf{B}_{k-1}^{\mathrm{filt}}\right).
  \end{align}$$
  
* We <strong>approximate the forecast distribution</strong> as,

  $$\begin{align}
  \pmb{x}_k &\sim N\left( \overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore}, \mathbf{B}_k^\mathrm{fore} \right),\\
  \pmb{x}_k^\mathrm{fore}&:= \mathcal{M}_k\left(\overline{\pmb{x}}_{k-1}^{\mathrm{filt}}\right),\\  
  \mathbf{B}_k^\mathrm{fore}&:=\mathbf{M}_k \mathbf{B}_{k-1}^{\mathrm{filt}}\mathbf{M}_k^\top.
  \end{align}$$
  
* The resulting <b>extended Kalman filter cost function</b> can thus be written as

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathcal{J}_{\mathrm{EKF}}(\pmb{x}) := \frac{1}{2} \parallel \pmb{x} - \overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore}\parallel_{\mathbf{B}_k^\mathrm{fore}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \parallel \pmb{y} - \mathcal{H}(\pmb{x})\parallel_{\mathbf{R}_k}^2,
  \end{align}$$
  which can similarly be minimized with quasi-Newton methods to find a local minima.

========================================================
### The extended Kalman filter

* The <b>extended Kalman filter</b> thus gives the improvement over 3D-VAR in that it uses the approximate, <strong>time-varying background covariance using the tangent-linear model</strong>.

* However, this comes with the cost of constructing and computing the evolution of a large covariance matrix in the tangent-linear model.

* For large-scale, nonlinear systems, <strong>explicitly constructing such a covariance can be prohibitively expensive</strong>.

* For this reason, one usually needs to make an additional approximation using the square root form of the equation in the weight-space.

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathcal{J}_{\mathrm{EKF}}(\pmb{w}) &:= \frac{1}{2} \parallel  \overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore} - \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{k}^\mathrm{fore} \pmb{w} - \overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore} \parallel_{\mathbf{B}^\mathrm{fore}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \parallel \pmb{y} - \mathcal{H}\left(\overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore}  + \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^\mathrm{fore}\pmb{w}\right) \parallel_{\mathbf{R}_k}^2\\
  &\approx \frac{1}{2}\parallel \pmb{w}\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}\parallel  \pmb{y} - \mathcal{H}\left(\overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore}\right) + \mathbf{H}_k \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^\mathrm{fore}\pmb{w} \parallel_{\mathbf{R}_k}^2,
  \end{align}$$
  where
  
  * $\left(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^\mathrm{i}\right)\left(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^\mathrm{i}\right)^\top \approx \mathbf{B}_k^{\mathrm{i}}$ is a <strong>reduced rank approximation of the covariance using</strong>, e.g., a truncated SVD;
  * $\mathbf{H}_k:= \nabla_{\pmb{x}} \mathcal{H}_k$ is the <strong>Jacobian of the nonlinear observation operator</strong>; and
  * the second term above is given by taking the <strong>Taylor expansion of the perturbation to the mean state through the observation operator</strong>.

========================================================
### The extended Kalman filter

* Notice that the approximate cost function

  $$\begin{align}
  \mathcal{J}_{\mathrm{EKF}}(\pmb{w}) &:=\frac{1}{2}\parallel \pmb{w}\parallel^2 + \frac{1}{2}\parallel  \pmb{y} - \mathcal{H}\left(\overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore}\right) + \mathbf{H}_k \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^\mathrm{fore}\pmb{w} \parallel_{\mathbf{R}_k}^2,\\
  \end{align}$$<br>
  is <b>actually quadratic in $\pmb{w}$</b>, as $\mathcal{H}\left(\overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore}\right)$ is a <strong>constant with respect to the optimization</strong>.
  
* Therefore, this represents a <b>fully linearized system</b>, performing an <strong>approximate Kalman filtering in the space of perturbations</strong>. 

* The usual right-transform analysis can be computed from the objective function above so that

  $$\begin{align}
  \overline{\pmb{x}}^\mathrm{filt}_k := \overline{\pmb{x}}_k^\mathrm{fore} + \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^\mathrm{fore} \overline{\pmb{w}} & &
  \mathbf{H}_{\mathcal{J}}&:= \nabla_{\pmb{w}}^2 \mathcal{J} & & \mathbf{T}:=\mathbf{H}_{\mathcal{J}}^{-\frac{1}{2}} & & \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{k}^\mathrm{filt}:= \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^\mathrm{fore}\mathbf{T} & & 
  \end{align}$$
  an entire recursion can be derived as above (and extended to include model error in the evolution of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^\mathrm{filt}$).

========================================================
### The extended Kalman filter

* The <b style="color:#1b9e77">accuracy of the approximation</b> in the extended Kalman filter depends strongly on:
  1. the <strong>nonlinearity of the state evolution</strong> $\mathcal{M}_k$ and if this can be well-approximated at first order by the tangent-linear model; and
  2. the <strong>nonlinearity of the observation operator</strong> $\mathcal{H}$ and if this can be well-approximated at first order by the Jacobian.
  
* For the former, this usually depends on <b>how long the forecast length is in time</b>, where for short forecast horizons this is often adequate.

  * For longer forecast horizons, the evolution of Gaussian perturbations is no longer appropriate, as the forecast begins to converge to the invariant "climatological" statistics.
  
* For this reason, one may intuitively consider <b style="color:#d95f02">interpolating between the long-time-average background covariance</b>, and <b style="color:#1b9e77">a time dependent covariance</b> in practice for the optimization weights.

  * This is part of the intuition behind <b>covariance hybridization</b> mentioned at the beginning of the lecture,
  
  * The other consideration is that if $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k^{\mathrm{fore}}$ is of <b>reduced rank</b>, this implies that <strong>correction in the optimized solution is restricted to a low-dimensional subspace</strong>.
  
  * If the subspace is too small, this may not be able to correct the growth of errors in the estimate, and <b>interpolating with a static, full-rank background</b> can <strong>rectify this sparse correction</strong>.
