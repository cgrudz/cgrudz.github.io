<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:
  * Extending the concept of random vectors -- stochastic processes
  * Continiuity in probability
  * Separability
  * Gaussian stochastic processes
  * Wiener Processes

========================================================
## Stochastic processes

* We are now familiar with the <b>Gaussian model for a random state</b>, and its <strong>centrality due to the central limit theorem</strong>.

  * Likewise, we have developed a variety of tools to extend the Gaussian model, and to efficiently simulate it numerically.

* We will now make a fundamental leap that will allow us to model time-varying random processes -- i.e., we will introduce <b>stochastic processes</b>.

* A <b>stochastic process</b> is an <strong>infinite collection of random variables</strong>. 

* We will ultimately use this object to model uncertain signals based on mechanistic processes;

  * however, we want to emphasize from the beginning that a <strong>stochastic process is just a generalization of a random variable / vector</strong>.

* However, unlike a random vector $\pmb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{N_x}$, a stochastic process requires considerably more care.

  * This is due to the fact that a stochastic process $\pmb{x}_t$ is the <strong>generalization of a random vector into infinite dimensions</strong>.
  
<blockquote>
<b>Stochastic Processes</b><br>
A <strong>stochastic process</strong> is a family of random variables, $X(\omega, t)$, indexed by
a real parameter $t \in T$ and defined on a common probability space $(\Omega, A, \mathcal{P} )$.
</blockquote>

* The "real parameter $t$" in the above is almost always taken a time variable. 

* Thus, a random process can be thought of as a <strong>function that takes both the sample point and time as arguments</strong>. 

* Hence, we will often use the notation $X(\omega, t)$, or $X_t$ for short, to denote a random variable depending on time. 


========================================================
### Stochastic processes

*  Note, in many cases we will actually <b>consider time to be discrete in nature</b>;

  * this is a consequence, in part, of the fact that we <strong>often have measurements discretely and not continuously in time</strong>. 

* If the parameter set $T = \mathbb{N}$, the natural numbers, then $X_t$ is often
called a random sequence to reflect the discrete nature of the time parameter.
  
  * In this case, we will often use a notation such as $X_k$ corresponding to a sequence of times $\{t_0, t_1, \cdots, t_k, \cdots\}$ to denote the discrete nature of the time variable.

* On the other hand, if $T = \mathbb{R}$, then $X_t$ is called either a random function or process. 

* We should also note that the values of $X_t$, for a fixed value of $t$, <strong>can also be a discrete or continuous random variable</strong>.

* If we look at random processes in a certain way, we can see that they are a <strong>natural
extension of the idea of random vectors to infinite collections</strong>:

$$\begin{align}
&\begin{matrix}\text{Random variable} & X \end{matrix} & \begin{matrix}\text{Random vector} & & \pmb{x}^\top:= \begin{pmatrix} X_1 & \cdots & X_{N_x}\end{pmatrix}\end{matrix}\\\\
&\begin{matrix}\text{Random sequence} & \begin{pmatrix} \cdots & X_k & \cdots \end{pmatrix}\end{matrix} &  \begin{matrix} \text{Random process} & \begin{pmatrix} \cdots & X_t & \cdots \end{pmatrix}\end{matrix}
\end{align}$$

* The key notion to take away is that a <b>random process is a set of time functions</b>, each of which is one possible outcome, $\omega$, out of the set of all possible outcomes, $\Omega$. 
* A random variable returns a real number, and a random process <strong>returns a continuously indexed collection of real numbers or a real-valued function</strong>.

========================================================
### Stochastic processes

* As a quick example, consider a sine wave with an amplitude given as a random variable taking on values from −1 to 1 with a uniform distribution:

  $$\begin{align}
  X(\omega, t) := A(\omega) \sin(t): \Omega \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} & & A(\omega) \sim U[-1, 1]
  \end{align}$$
  
* Again, we emphasize that the random variable $X$ takes $\omega$ and returns a function. 

  * In particular, if we know which sample point, $\omega$, we have selected, we know the plot of the function $X_t$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$.

* We can consider this in Python as follows, where `A` below is a uniform random variable on $[-1,1]$


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
A = np.random.uniform(low=-1, high=1)
A
```

```
0.3929383711957233
```

* Having determined the particular outcome for $\omega$, we now define a function in time given by

  $$\begin{align}
  0.3929383711957233 * \sin(t).
  \end{align}$$

========================================================
### Stochastic processes

* We plot the function defined on the last slide for 5 cycles of sine:


```python
time_points = np.linspace(start=0, stop=10*np.pi, num=10000)
plt.subplots(figsize=(24, 6))
```

```
(<Figure size 2400x600 with 1 Axes>, <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7fec2c398940>)
```

```python
plt.plot(time_points, A*np.sin(time_points))
```

```
[<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x7fec2bdd3ba8>]
```

```python
plt.show()
```

========================================================
### Stochastic processes

* We just showed how <b>fixing $\omega$</b> yields an <strong>outcome for a random function defined for all time</strong>.

  * This particular function, defined over the time variable $t$, is known as a <b>sample path or a realization of the random process</b>.

* On the other hand, if we fix $t$ and let $X$ vary over $\omega$, i.e.,

  $$\begin{align}
  X_{t_0}(\omega) := X(\omega,t)|_{t=t_0},
  \end{align}$$
  
* we get a random variable $X_{t_0}$ defined on $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P})$ with 
 
 $$\begin{align}
 \{\omega : X_{t_0} (\omega) \leq x \} \in \mathcal{A},
 \end{align}$$
 i.e., these form the <b>generating sets of the observable events</b> for the probability space.

* This is what is meant that the parameters $t$ indexes a family of random variables.

========================================================
### Stochastic processes

* We can consider random processes as infinite-dimensional extensions of the idea of random vectors. 

* However, when we extend our ideas to <b>infinite dimensions</b>, <strong>new complications arise</strong>. 

* With random vectors, we can completely define the probability of the vector as a collection of random variables by the joint probability,

  $$\begin{align}
  P(x_1, \cdots, x_{N_x}) := \mathcal{P}\left( X_1(\omega) \leq x_1 , \cdots, X_{N_x}(\omega) \leq x_{N_x}\right)
  \end{align}$$
  
* However, when $T$ is an infinite set, we have to be more careful. 

* If $T$ is a <b>countably infinite set</b>, then we can <strong>characterize the process</strong> with sets of the form
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \{\omega: X(\omega,t_k) \leq a, \quad k= 1,\cdots\} = \cap_{k=1}^\infty \{\omega : X_{t_k} \leq a\};
  \end{align}$$
  
 * in the measure-theoretic approach, this type of countably-infinite intersection still generates the observable events of the process.
  
* However, trouble arises with the <b>uncountable infinity of the continuum</b> for such constructions, where 

  $$\begin{align}
  \{\omega: X(\omega,t_k) \leq a, \quad k= 1,\cdots\} = \cap_{t\in\mathbb{R}} \{\omega : X_{t_k} \leq a\}
  \end{align}$$
  an <strong>intersection over a continuum can lead to problems</strong> with our construction of observable events.
  
 * In particular, if we follow the above alone, the <b>probability of</b> $\mathcal{P}\left(X_t \geq 0 : \forall t\in[0,1]\right)$ <b>may not actually be defined</b>.
 
 
========================================================
## Continuity in probability

* To get around the problems which might arise from continuous-time stochastic processes,
we need to add two more conditions to our process.

<blockquote>
<b>Continuous in probability</b><br>
A stochastic process $X(\omega, t)$ is said to be <strong>continuous in probability</strong> at $t$ if
$$\begin{align}
\lim_{s\rightarrow t} \mathcal{P}\left(\vert X(\omega, s) -  X(\omega, t) \vert \geq \epsilon\right) =0
\end{align}$$
for all $\epsilon > 0$.
</blockquote>

* Note that in the above, the probability we are referring to is over all possible outcomes $\omega\in \Omega$.

* This means there is <b>such a small set of possible $\omega$</b> for which we would see a discontinuity, that the <strong>probability of observing such an event is zero</strong>.
  
* Being continuous in probability means then that the <b>possibility of seeing a nonzero jump in zero time</b> has <strong>probability zero</strong>.

========================================================
## Separability

* Our second condition is known as separability, which is described as follows.

<blockquote>
<b>Separability</b><br>
A stochastic process $X(\omega, t)$ is said to be <strong>separable</strong> if there exists a countable, dense
set $S \subset T$ such that for any closed set $K \subset [-\infty, \infty]$ the two sets
$$\begin{align}
A_1 = \{\omega : X(\omega, t) \in K, \forall t \in T \} & & A_2 =\{\omega: X(\omega, t)\in K, \forall s \in S\}
\end{align}$$
differ by a set $A_0$ such that $\mathcal{P}\left(A_0\right)=0$.
</blockquote>

* Separability means that for a <b>continuous-parameter random process</b>, <strong>it is possible to analyze it like a discrete-parameter one</strong>.

* When we say that $S$ is dense in $T$, we mean that $S$ must contain enough points
of $T$ so as to provide <strong>essentially a complete representation</strong> of $T$.

* That is, if we plotted out the set $\{X(\omega, t) : t \in S\}$ versus $t$, it would look indistinguishable from $\{X(\omega, t), t \in T \}$.

* Lets suppose that $T = \mathbb{R}$, the real line, or perhaps the positive real line $\mathbb{R}^+$.

* The simplest way to get a separating set of the continuous-time interval $T$ is to simply choose $S$ to be the set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q} \cap T$.

* Mathematically, what this means is that for any point $t \in T$, there exists a discrete sequence $t_k \in S$ such that $t_k \rightarrow t$. 

* Thus, if $X(t, \omega)$ is a separable process, it is such that $X(t_k , \omega) \rightarrow X(t, \omega)$ except on the zero probability set mentioned in the definition.

* We, therefore, have <strong>well-defined discretized limits in time</strong> with probability one.


========================================================
## Gaussian processes

* Just like we extended the Gaussian to multiple variables, we can now <b>extend the (multivariate) Gaussian</b> to a <strong>family of Gaussian random (vectors) variables parameterized by time</strong>.

* We will need to start with identifying the notion of independence properly for a stochastic process.

<blockquote>
<b>Independent increments</b><br>
Let $X$ be a random process defined on the time interval, $T$. Let $t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_n$ be a partition of the time interval, $T$. If the increments, $X(t_k) − X(t_{k−1})$, are mutually independent random variables for any partition of $T$, then $X$ is said to be a <strong>process with independent increments</strong>.
</blockquote>

* In the above, this is to say that if we take arbitrary, discrete time points $t_{k-1} &lt; t_{k} &lt; t_{k+1} \in T$, the following holds

 $$\begin{align}
 \mathcal{P}\left( X_{k+1} - X_{k} \leq a | X_{k} - X_{k-1} = b\right) = \mathcal{P}\left( X_{k+1} - X_{k} \leq a\right),
 \end{align}$$
 and vice-versa in the time indices.
 
* In particular, the size of any <strong>past difference in realizations</strong> <b>doesn't affect the probability of any future difference</b> in realizations.

========================================================
## Gaussian processes

<div style="float:left; width:60%">
<ul>
   <li>We now introduce the notion of a <b>Gaussian process</b>, and two of its quintessential applications.</li>
<blockquote>
<b>Gaussian processes</b><br>
We say that a random process, $X_t$, is a <strong>Gaussian process</strong> if for every finite
collection, $X_{1}, X_{2}, \cdots , X_{N_x}$, the corresponding density function,
$$\begin{align}
p(x_1 , . . . , x_n ),
\end{align}$$
is a Gaussian density function, for the joint, multivariate Gaussian in $\pmb{x}^\top:= \begin{pmatrix}X_1, & \cdots, & X_{N_x} \end{pmatrix}$.
</blockquote>
   <li>A commonly understood Gaussian process is actually <b>"white noise"</b>, visualized to the right.</li>

<div style="float:right; width:40%" class="fragment">
<img style="width:100%", src="white-noise.gif" alt="White noise."/>
</div>
<div style="float:left; width:100%">
<ul>
   <li>White noise corresponds, typically, to a Gaussian process as above such that for any two time points, $t_0, t_1$:</li>
   <ul>
      <li>$\mathbb{E}\left[X_0\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[X_1\right]=\overline{x}$ and $\mathrm{var}\left(X_0\right) = \mathrm{var}\left(X_1\right) = \sigma^2$; and</li>
      <li>$X_0$ and $X_1$ are independent.</li>
   </ul>
   <li>A formal mathematical definition can actually be quite a bit more complicated, but this is a good intuitive way to understand the white noise Gaussian process.</li>
   <li>We can think of <strong>white noise as adding random shocks to a system</strong>, with an average value of the shock being $\overline{x}$.</li>
   <li>When $\overline{x}=0$, this corresponds to a <b>sequence of perturbations that "fuzz", but do not bias, the underlying process</b>.</li>
</ul>

========================================================
## The Weiner process

<div style="float:left; width:60%">
<ul>
   <li>A related application of Gaussian processes is one that we will use frequently in stochastic, continuous-time models.</li>
<blockquote>
<b>Wiener process</b><br>
A continuous-time stochastic process is denoted a <strong>Wiener process</strong> $W_{t}$ if it has the following properties:
<ul>
   <li>$W_0:= 0$,</li>
   <li>$W$ has independent increments, as defined earlier;</li>
   <li>The increments $W_{t+s} - W_{t} \sim N(0,s)$; and</li>
   <li>$W_t$ is continuous in $t$.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
   <li>The Wiener process is a common model for the interaction of a particle suspended in fluid as it bounces off other particles in its evolution.</li>
   <li>In particular, this is also known as a Brownian motion, as pictured to the right.</li>
</ul>
