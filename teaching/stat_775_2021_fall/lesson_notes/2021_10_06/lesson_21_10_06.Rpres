<h2>Outline</h2>

* The following topics will be covered in this lecture:
  * Observability and controllability
  * Filter boundedness and stability
  * Innovation and residual statistics
  * Estimating $\mathbf{R}_k$
  * Estimating $\mathbf{Q}_k$
  * Biased priors


========================================================
## Motivation

* In the last lecture, we saw a general derivation of the Kalman filter equations for a discrete Gauss-Markov model.
   
   * This includes both the classic approach, and the more <strong>numerically stable</strong> <b>square root covariance update equations</b>.

* We also have a number of <b>guarantees of the optimality</b> of the solution in the state estimation:

  * for a <b>linear-Gaussian system</b>, the <strong>conditional mean is the minimum variance linear unbiased estimator</strong>; and
  * is the <strong>maximum a posteriori estimate</strong>; and
  * the mean and covariance <strong>parameterize the Bayesian marginal posterior</strong> directly, knowing that this is a Gaussian, derived as 

  $$\begin{align}
  p(\pmb{x}_k|\pmb{y}_{k:1}) = \int p(\pmb{x}_{k:0}|\pmb{y}_{k:1})\mathrm{d}\pmb{x}_{k-1:0}
  \end{align}$$
  having averaged out all the past states from the joint posterior in time.

* When the error distributions are <b>non-Gaussian</b>, this still <strong>remains the BLUE</strong>, but may <strong>not parameterize the posterior nor be the maximum a posteriori estimate</strong>.

* However, even if the governing mechanistic laws are linear, $\mathbf{M}_k$, and the observation operator is linear $\mathbf{H}_k$, with Gaussian error distributions

  $$\begin{align}
  \pmb{x}_0 \sim N(\overline{\pmb{x}}_0 , \mathbf{B}_0), & &
  \pmb{w}_k \sim N(\pmb{0}, \mathbf{Q}_k), & &
  \pmb{v}_k  \sim N(\pmb{0}, \mathbf{R}_k),
  \end{align}$$
  
 * we <strong>generally do not actually know any of the above parameters</strong> $\overline{\pmb{x}}_0, \mathbf{B}_0, \mathbf{Q}_k,\mathbf{R}_k$ in practice...
 
========================================================
### Motivation

* Two important <b>related questions</b> emerge then:

  * The question of how do we guarantee that the background error covariance $\mathbf{B}_k$ <strong>does not grow to infinite variances is known as filter boundedness</strong>.
  
  * The question of how do we guarantee "optimal" performance of a linear Kalman filter with <strong>uncertain parameters is known as filter stability</strong>.

* In the case that $\mathbf{Q}_k$ and $\mathbf{R}_k$ are known, 

  * and they satisfy <b>"observability"</b> and <b>"controlability"</b> conditions, 
  
* it turns out that the <strong>initialization of the prior covariance doesn't imperil the long-term performance</strong>, either in the sense of boundedness or stability.

* When these parameters are unknown, a variety of techniques have been developed to estimate these parameters;

  * we will consider some <b>classical results</b> based on <strong>"innovation" and "residual" statistics</strong>, though more modern approaches may consider, e.g., Bayesian hierarchical models.
  
* Additionally, we will consider the issue of a <b>biased first prior</b> and empirical means of handling this.

========================================================
## Observability and controllability

* Recall the discrete Gauss-Markov model,

  $$\begin{align}
  \pmb{x}_k &= \mathbf{M}_k \pmb{x}_{k-1} + \pmb{w}_k, \\
  \pmb{y}_k &= \mathbf{H}_k \pmb{x}_k + \pmb{y}_k.
  \end{align}$$

* To introduce the <b>fundamental boundedness / stability result</b> of the linear Kalman filter, we need to introduce the following definitions.

<blockquote>
<b>The information matrix</b><br>
For the model defined above, the time-varying <strong>information matrix</strong> is defined as,
$$\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\Phi}_{k:j} := \sum_{l=j}^k \mathbf{M}_{k:l}^{-\top} \mathbf{H}_l^\top \mathbf{R}_l^{-1} \mathbf{H}_l\mathbf{M}_{k:l}^{-1}
\end{align}$$
</blockquote>

* The information matrix above can be considered to be a representation of <strong>how much information is transmitted backward-in-time</strong> from time $t_k$ to time $t_l$ through the observations over this window.

<blockquote>
<b>The controllability matrix</b><br>
For the model defined above, the time-varying <strong>controllability matrix</strong> is defined as,
$$\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}_{k:j}:= \sum_{l=j}^k \mathbf{M}_{k:l}\mathbf{Q}_l  \mathbf{M}_{k:l}^\top
\end{align}$$
</blockquote>

* The controllability matrix above respectively represents how an <strong>arbitrary initial state can be driven to another state by the sequence of noise realizations</strong> combined with the mechanistic laws.

========================================================
### Observability and controllability

* Two key concepts about the observation model and the mechanistic dynamic model then determine the boundedness and stability properties of the filter.

* In order to understand this, we need to introduce the partial ordering on symmetric, positive semi-definite matrices.

<blockquote>
<b>Partial ordering on symmetric, positive semi-definite matrices</b><br>
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be symmetric, positive semi-definite matrices.  Then we can declare
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{A} \leq \mathbf{B}
\end{align}$$
if and only if all of the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{B}$ are greater than or equal to those of $\mathbf{A}$. 
</blockquote>

* The above ordering allows us to consider a variety of properties about the covariance of the estimator, including <strong>how we mean to bound the covariance</strong>.
  
  * Similarly, this allows us to place lower and upper bounds on the information and controllability matrices.

<blockquote>
<b>Uniform complete observability / controllability</b><br>
We say that the system is <strong>uniformly completely observable (respectively controllable)</strong> if and only if there exists constants $0 &lt; a &lt; b &lt; \infty$ independent of $k$, and some $N\geq 1$, for which if $k$ is sufficiently large
$$\begin{align}
a\mathbf{I} \leq \boldsymbol{\Phi}_{k, k-N} \leq b \mathbf{I} \\
a \mathbf{I} \leq \boldsymbol{\Upsilon}_{k, k- N} \leq b \mathbf{I}
\end{align}$$
for all such $k$.
</blockquote>


========================================================
## Filter boundedness and stability

* The previous <b>uniform complete observability and controllability</b> conditions respectively guarantee that:

  * given finitely many observations, the <strong>initial state of the system</strong> ($N$ steps back in time) <strong>can be reconstructed from this information as a linear combination</strong>;
  
  * respectively, the controllability condition describes the <strogn>ability to move the system from any initial state to a desired state given a finite sequence of control actions</strong>—in
our case the moves are the realizations of model error.
  
* The model error controllabilty condition thus describes a kind of <b>memorlyless condition similar to ergodicity</b>;

  * particularly, <strong>no state of the system remains completely time-invariant with respect to the dynamics</strong>, and the model is free to explore the entire state space.

* Put together, this gives the <b>fundamental result of the classical Kalman filter</b>,

<blockquote>
<b>Filter boundedness and stability</b><br>
Let $\mathbf{B}_0 &gt; 0\mathbf{I}$ be any initialization of the prior covariance satisfying this lower bound on the partial ordering.  There exists a constants $0 &lt; a &lt; b &lt; \infty$ and <strong>universal sequence</strong> $\overline{\mathbf{B}}_k$ for which, if $\mathbf{B}_k$ is generated by the Kalman filtering equations with $\mathbf{B}_0$ as the initialization,
$$\begin{align}
\parallel \mathbf{B}_k - \overline{\mathbf{B}}_k \parallel \rightarrow 0
\end{align}$$
exponentially fast in $k$, and $a\mathbf{I} &lt; \overline{\mathbf{B}}_k &lt; b\mathbf{I}$ for all $k$.
</blockquote>

* The above means that even for <b>any first prior covariance</b> (background uncertainty), the <strong>system exponentially forgets about the prior and reaches a unique, bounded variance, optimal sequence of posterior estimates</strong>. 


========================================================
### Filter boundedness and stability

* We should just remark that it is also possible to derive <b>filter boundedness and stability</b> results in the case where the <strong>system is sufficiently observed but is noiseless</strong>.

* This type of system is sometimes denoted a <b>"perfect model"</b>, as the <strong>mechanistic process</strong> $\mathbf{M}_k$ <strong>completely describes the evolution of the uncertain initial data</strong>.

* This again is in relation to, e.g., an initial value problem with a linear system of ODEs, or with a nonlinear system of ODEs in the space of perturbations (the tangent space), when the tangent-linear model is sufficiently accurate.

* Under a <b>generic ergodicity assumption</b> (that holds almost surely for the tangent-linear model);

  * and an <b>assumption of the uniform complete observability</b> of the system's dynamical instabilities;
  
  * with a <b>sufficient rank of the initial covariance</b>;
  
* all covariances converge to a universal sequence $\overline{\mathbf{B}}_k$ which has a <strong>column span identical to the unstable and neutral covariant / backward Lyapunov vectors</strong> for the system.

* This is to say that the system's <b>predictive uncertainty</b> is <strong>asymptotically low-rank</strong>, and the only <strong>non-zero variances are in directions of the dynamic instability</strong> of the mechanistic model sequence $\mathbf{M}_k$.

* This is a modern result that provides some additional extensions to the classical filter boundedness / stability analysis for <strong>systems defined by a "perfect model" as above</strong>.

========================================================
## Innovation and residual statistics

* Consider how we earlier defined the Kalman filter innovation  and the Kalman filter residual, but let us replace the conditional mean with the <b>conditional expectation</b> which we will denote $\hat{\pmb{x}}_{k|j}$.

  $$\begin{align}
  \pmb{\delta}_{k|k-1} &:= \pmb{y}_k - \mathbf{H}_k \hat{\pmb{x}}_{k|k-1},\\
  \pmb{\epsilon}_{k|k} &:= \pmb{x}_{k|k} - \hat{\pmb{x}}_{k|k}.
  \end{align}$$

* In the above, we are considering the <b>conditional mean</b> as a <strong>conditional expectation, depending on the outcomes of $\pmb{y}_{k:1}$</strong>.

* Important properties about these variables are actually their orthogonality properties, and their independence properties, which we discuss as follows.

<blockquote>
<b>Properties of the innovations / residuals</b><br>
The innovations and residuals defined above satisfy the following general properties of least-squares estimators:
$$\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}\left[\pmb{\epsilon}_{k|k} \hat{\pmb{x}}_{k|k}^\top \right] &= \pmb{0} & & \mathbb{E}\left[\pmb{\delta}_{k|k-1} \pmb{\delta}_{j|j-1}^\top\right] = \delta_{k,j} \left( \mathbf{H}_k \mathbf{B}_{k|k-1}\mathbf{H}_k^\top + \mathbf{R}_k\right)
 \\
 \mathbb{E}\left[\pmb{\epsilon}_{k|k} \pmb{y}_k^\top \right]&= \pmb{0} & & \mathbb{E}\left[\pmb{\delta}_{k|k} \pmb{\delta}_{j|j}^\top\right] = \delta_{k,j}  \mathbf{R}_k
\end{align}$$
where $\delta_{k,j}$ above is the Kronecker delta.
</blockquote>

* Particularly, the <strong>estimator and its error, and the error and the observations</strong>, are <b>uncorrelated</b>.

* Moreover, the <b>residuals are white-in-time</b>, with the <strong>known non-zero covariance given above only for matching time indices</strong>.

========================================================
## Estimating $\mathbf{R}_k$

* The importance of the last properties is in the fact that it gives a <b>criterion</b> for the <strong>accurate specification of the error statistics in the algorithm</strong>.

* Particularly, if we suppose that $\mathbf{R}_k$ is <strong>time-invariant, or slowly varying</strong>, we can <b>use the innovation statistics to estimate</b> $\mathbf{R}_k$.

* For simplicity, suppose $\mathbf{R}_k\equiv \mathbf{R}$ is constant;

  * then with an unbiased initial prior, supposing that the model is specified correctly, the model error is specified correctly and $\mathbf{R}$ is specified correctly
  
  $$\begin{align}
  \hat{\mathbf{R}} := \frac{1}{L} \sum_{k=1}^L \left[\pmb{y}_k - \mathbf{H}_k \hat{\pmb{x}}_{k|k} \right]\left[\pmb{y}_k - \mathbf{H}_k \hat{\pmb{x}}_{k|k} \right]^\top
  \end{align}$$
  can be shown to be an unbiased estimator for $\mathbf{R}$, though will be reduced rank when the number of lagged residuals $L &lt; N_y$.

* A <b>miss-match between this estimate and the specified</b> $\mathbf{R}$ used in the Kalman filter equations <strong>evidences an incorrectly specified</strong> $\mathbf{R}$.

  * This can thus be used to tune $\mathbf{R}$ to find a "correct" observation error covariance.

* Alternatively, various techniques can then be used to <b>specify the observation error covariance adaptively</b>, such as <strong>expectation maximization</strong> using the above relationship.

========================================================
## Estimating $\mathbf{Q}_k$

* As with the observation error covariance, we can similarly estimate the <b>model error covariance</b> in the case in which $\mathbf{Q}_k$ is <strong>time-invariant or slowly varies in time</strong>.

* For simplicity, suppose that $\mathbf{Q}_k \equiv \mathbf{Q}$ fixed in time.

  * Similarly, with an unbiased initial prior, supposing that the model is specified correctly, the model error is specified correctly and $\mathbf{R}$ is specified correctly

  $$\begin{align}
  \hat{\mathbf{Q} } := \frac{1}{L} \sum_{k=1}^L \left[\hat{\pmb{x}}_{k|k} - \mathbf{M}_k \hat{\pmb{x}}_{k-1|k-1} \right]\left[\hat{\pmb{x}}_{k|k} - \mathbf{M}_k \hat{\pmb{x}}_{k-1|k-1} \right]^\top
  \end{align}$$
  can be shown to be an unbiased estimator for $\mathbf{Q}$.
  
* As with the last estimator, $\hat{\mathbf{Q}}$ will be reduced rank if the number of lagged states $L &lt; N_x$.

* This similarly give a <b>criterion</b> to check <strong>if the model error is specified correctly in the simulations</strong>;

  * alternatively, <b>adaptive error estimation</b> is a rich area and has likewise been performed in classical settings with <strong>expectation maximization</strong>.
  

========================================================
## Biased priors

* You may note that the variety of results we have given have <strong>relied on a critical assumption that the prior</strong> 

  $$\begin{align}
  N(\overline{\pmb{x}}_0 ,\mathbf{B}_0)
  \end{align}$$
  is <b>actually unbiased</b>, i.e., $\mathbb{E}\left[\pmb{x}_0\right] = \overline{\pmb{x}}_0$.

* This is actually a <b>non-trivial criterion to satisfy</b>, and it <strong>isn't easily dealt with in practice</strong>.

* In principle, if we gather enough data, we may be able to find an unbiased estimate for the initialization of a simulation.

  * However, the reality of this is actually quite challenging, and we may in general initialize with a biased prior.
  
* Unlike the general convergence of background covariances, <strong>biased priors aren't guaranteed generally to lose their initial bias</strong>, and may have <b>long-term effects in the prediction cycle</b>.

* Various techniques are used in practice, including estimating the biases of predictions;

  * we may also consider that, the effect of a biased prior is reduced by having a larger background uncertainty.
  
* If we <b>inflate our background uncertainty</b> (increase the variances), we put <strong>less importance on our prior knowledge and the algorithm is more receptive to the data</strong>.

* Particularly, this reflects the trade off in the optimal weights in the relative uncertainty of the observations and the background state.

* As a general rule, it is <strong>better to over estimate our background uncertainty than to underestimate</strong> -- the later can often lead to what is known as <b>filter divergence</b> in real problems.
