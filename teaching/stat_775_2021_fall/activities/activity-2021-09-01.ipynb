    "\n",
    " * Import a library into a program using import libraryname.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use the numpy library to work with arrays in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    " * The expression `array.shape` gives the shape of an array.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use `array[x, y]` to select a single element from a 2D array.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Array indices start at 0, not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use `low:high` to specify a slice that includes the indices from `low` to `high-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use `# some kind of explanation` to add comments to programs.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Use `np.mean(array)`, `np.std(array)`, `np.quantile(array)`, `np.max(array)`, and `np.min(array)` to calculate simple statistics.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Use `sp.mode(array)` to compute additional statistics.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Use `np.mean(array, axis=0)` or `np.mean(array, axis=1)` to calculate statistics across the specified axis."
