<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Final Exam STAT 445/645,<br> Fall 2020</h1>



<p>Instructor: Colin Grudzien<br></p>
<div id="assignment" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignment:</h2>
<div id="summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For the final project, you are to to write a research report in mathematical typesetting software. You can use any software you prefer, but the report is required to be produced in a clean, easy-to-read document with the required document structure below. Figures should be captioned, with clear and easy-to-interpret labels and graphics. The final report must be uploaded in a PDF format to Webcampus. The report should be written in 12 point font, have 1.0 or 1.5 line-spacing and be approximately 7 - 10 pages long, not including references or the appendix of code in the page count.</p>
You are expected to use resources from outside of this course to investigate a topic of your choice among options below and summarize this topic according to the assignment objectives and rubric. Topics that can be chosen are:
<ul>
<li>
Robust regression
</li>
<li>
Logistic regression
</li>
<li>
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
</li>
<li>
Expectation maximization
</li>
<li>
Kullback-Leibler divergence
</li>
<li>
Principal component analysis
</li>
<li>
Particle filters
</li>
<li>
Kalman filter
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your report needs to identify an example where this technique is used in a research or replication paper. Examples from blogs are acceptable for works referenced and may help with code implementations, but you will need to draw your particular example from a scholarly source. You should expect to read background material from other textbooks and papers to understand the technique and to effectively analyze the chosen example. Some of these topics may be more difficult than others depending on your discipline and mathematical preparation before the class, and you will need to select a topic carefully. For this reason, you must have an interview with the instructor to discuss a proposal for your report before your topic will be approved. On a case-by-case basis, the instructor may accept a proposal for a different topic. <strong>If a topic proposal is not approved by the instructor, the final project will not be accepted for credit.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="document-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Document structure</h3>
<p>The document should be structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 1:</strong> Introduce your topic, discussing how it fits in within different frameworks of modeling in computational statistics. Motivate the method by answering why statisticians use this technique versus different forms of regression/ MLE/ MCMC already seen in class. Discuss how does this technique address limitations of other techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Section 2:</strong> Discuss the technique, its derivation and the assumptions that must be satisfied in order for the technique’ performance to be satisfactory and/or optimal. Discuss what limitations this technique itself has.</li>
<li><strong>Section 3:</strong> Discuss a real example of this technique in practice. You should motivate the example, discuss where the example is drawn from and what the purpose was of this example, e.g., what questions were the authors trying to answer. Discuss what analysis was performed in this example in the source and why this technique was relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Section 4:</strong> Identify and discuss how this technique is implemented in R, or how you can write this technique into an R script by coding it yourself. Outline a research plan on how you can replicate the results in the example, including what packages and data you will need, and what components you will need to code yourself to complete the task.</li>
<li><strong>Section 5:</strong> If required in your approved project proposal, reproduce the example that you selected using R and discuss the results. You should discuss if your analysis matches the selected example – if it does not, you should be able to defend your own analysis. If your proposal does not include replicating the result, an alternative assignment will be included in this section by approval by the instructor.</li>
<li><strong>Section 6:</strong> Conclusions and summary of your work. Discuss what further analysis you would make on this example if you had additional time.</li>
<li><strong>Section 7:</strong> Works cited.</li>
<li><strong>Section 8:</strong> Appendix of R code.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
<p>Upon completing the report, the student will demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to learn the context and the appropriate use of a novel technique in statistical computation;</li>
<li>the ability to independently investigate, analyze and assimilate scholarly statistical literature;</li>
<li>the ability to design and implement a replication study of a computational result; and</li>
<li>the ability to raise new research questions and propose further investigation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="rubric" class="section level3">
<h3>Rubric</h3>
<p>The rubric below describes the necessary work delivered per category and associated points in this assignment for full credit. Reports that do not address all of these points, or give inadequate attention to these points will receive partial credit. Adequate attention is contextual and subjective, based on the problem itself and the overall work performed in the report. <strong>Students are encouraged to discuss their report in a rough draft with the instructor to get feedback on how to better address these points. Addiitonally, reports that do not follow document outline, do not use clear language, have formatting or writing errors, or unprofessional figures may be penalized for some of the points below.</strong></p>
