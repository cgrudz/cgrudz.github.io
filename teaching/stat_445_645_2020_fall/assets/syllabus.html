<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Announcements and course updates will be posted in <a href="https://unr.canvaslms.com/login/canvas" target="blank">Webcampus</a>. Students are expected to keep up-to-date on the course by reading these announcements for important information on assignments, midterms, etc.</p>
<div id="health-and-safety-updates" class="section level3">
<h3>Health and safety updates</h3>
<p>The University of Nevada, Reno publishes it’s information for students including important policy updates and forms in <a href="https://www.unr.edu/coronavirus/students" target="blank">this page</a>. Students are expected to keep up-to-date with official communications from the university regarding health and safety, and university policies.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Help &amp; Questions</h3>
<p>There will be a classroom discussion forum where you can seek help from the instructor and peers about the assignments. Some assignments will require that you post and discuss results in this forum.</p>
<p>The best way to contact the instructor is via email or message within Webcampus. Messages received before 16:00 during business days will usually get a response the same day. Emails received after 16:00 or during the weekend are not guaranteed a same-day response. Longer questions will not be answered by email and will be directed to appointments or office hours.</p>
<p>The instructor will be <strong>available from 4:00 - 5:00 PM MonWed for public office hours and questions, shared with students from STAT 757</strong>. If you cannot attend office hours or if you need to discuss something privately you can set an appointment with the instructor directly.</p>
</div>
<div id="netiquette" class="section level3">
<h3>Netiquette</h3>
<p>When communicating online, you should always:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Treat your instructor and peers with respect, even in email or in any other online communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Use clear and concise language. Be respective of readers’ time and attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that all college level communication should have correct spelling and grammar.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid slang terms and texting abbreviations.</p></li>
<li><p>Use standard fonts that are optimized for online reading (e.g., sans serif) along with a consistent and readable size (12 or 14 pt.)</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid using the caps lock feature AS IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS YELLING.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit and possibly avoid the use of emoticons. Not everyone knows how to interpret them.</p></li>
<li><p>Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm as tone is sometimes lost in an email or discussion post and your message might be taken literally or offensively.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful sharing personal information online (both yours and other’s).</p></li>
<li><p>Always give proper credit when referencing or quoting another source. (Corollary: Don’t copy and paste another student’s post and claim it as original as that is essentially plagiarism.)</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t repeat someone else’s post without adding something of your own to it. (See corollary above regarding reuse of someone else’s post.)</p></li>
<li><p>Always be respectful of others’ opinions even when they differ from your own. When you disagree with someone, you should express your differing opinion in a respectful, non-critical way. (Corollary: Do not make personal or insulting remarks.)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Course description</h2>
<div id="content" class="section level3">
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>This course introduces students to computational statistical methods within a modern computing environment. The first part of this course will be devoted to learning the R language and basic programming skills. The second part of this course reviews univariate statistics seen in the prerequisites, but within a computational framework. The third part of this course introduces basics concepts and computational techniques for understanding root finding and minimization/maximization methods using multivariate distributions, numerical linear algebra, numerical integration and numerical differentiation. In the last part of this course, students are introduced to three different frameworks for statistical modeling, using regression, maximum likelihood estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. A final report is required for graduate students and is optional for undergraduate students as in the <a href="#final_exam_policy">final exam policy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-for-online-learning" class="section level3">
<h3>Structure for online learning</h3>
<p>This class will follow a flipped design in which students are expected to watch one or more short lectures before the class session. This lecture will cover content that is relevant to the day’s activity in class. Class sessions will be held on Zoom and students are expected to attend the Zoom meeting to work on the day’s activities with their cohort. The day’s activities will require posting a discussion of the results according to the assignment rubric in the forum for completion credit. Quizzes and Midterms are taken online, open-book, open-note in WebCampus, but students are expected to work alone on these exams.</p>

<div id="late-policy-and-exceptions" class="section level2">
<h2>Late policy and exceptions</h2>
<p>There are no makeups for quizzes, exams or participation except for university recognized activities or exceptional circumstances, as per university policy. To accommodate unforeseen circumstances, <strong>the lowest quiz or homework score and the lowest two participation scores will be dropped from the final grade calculation</strong>. For undergraduates, a midterm score can be replaced with the final project score only once. If a student feels confident in R scripting at the start of the course and can demonstrate previous work, all DataCamp assignments can be excused and replaced with the score they receieve on the Midterm 1 Project. This is approved on a case-by-case basis by the instructor.</p>
<p>If a student needs to miss class due to participation in official university activities or a religious observance, they <strong>must make arrangements with the instructor at least one week prior to the date in question – the absence will not be given consideration without this advanced notice</strong>. In cases of absences due to extended illness, family emergency, bereavement, or other compelling reason, students should notify the instructor as soon as possible and <strong>within one week of the start of the absence</strong>. The instructor has the right to request formal, written documentation in such cases as they deem appropriate.

<h2>Academic success services</h2>
<p>A common habit among successful students is to seek help outside of the classroom. Your student fees cover use of the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/mathcenter">Math Center</a> (784-4433), <a href="https://www.%20unr.edu/tutoring-center">Tutoring Center</a> (784-6801), and <a href="https://www.unr.edu/writing-center">University Writing Center</a> (784-6030). These centers support your classroom learning; it is your responsibility to take advantage of their services.</p>
