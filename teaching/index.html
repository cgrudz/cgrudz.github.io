<h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
<p>
Interdisciplinary learning is a reality in the future of any student pursuing applied mathematics and statistics. Whether in academia or industry, 
researchers must rely on their communication skills collaborating with experts from other fields.  
To better prepare students academically for their futures, I believe that group work, experimental and case study learning are essential teaching methods to include in the classroom.  
As a supplement to lectures, non-traditional classroom experiences deepen studentsâ€™ understanding,
allowing them to apply theoretical concepts to problems which require more than the repetition of a method.

<button class="accordion"><h3>Data Assimilation Tutorials</h3></button>
    <div class="accordian_panel">
        <p>
				I have developed a series of lectures on data assimilation that are freely available but are currently a work in progress &ndash; check back for updates.
				Currently  my <a href="https://github.com/cgrudz/Tutorial_on_DA" target="blank">Data assimilation tutorials</a> from the London Mathematical Society summer 
				research school are available in my github.  You can find an iterated version of the lecture on particle filters 
				<a href="./data_assimilation_tutorials/bootstrap/hidden_markov_models_and_bootstrap_particle_filter.html" target="blank">here</a>.

<button class="accordion"><h3>Data Assimilation Package in Python for Experimental Research (DAPPER)</h3></button>
    <div class="accordian_panel">
        <p>
	<a href="https://github.com/nansencenter/DAPPER" target="blank"><strong>DAPPER</strong></a> is a set of templates and educational tutorials for learning the implementation, and benchmarking the performance, of data assimilation (DA) methods.
        DAPPER reproduces numerical results (benchmarks) reported in the literature, and facilitates comparative studies, thus promoting the reliability and relevance of the results. 
        DAPPER is open source, written in Python, and focuses on readability; 
        this promotes the reproduction and dissemination of the underlying science, and makes it easy to adapt and extend.  
        </p>
        <p>
	I am a coauthor of the data assimilation educational tutorials, collaborating with the lead author <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick_Raanes" target="blank">
	Patrick Raanes</a>.  For questions regarding DAPPER, please contact Patrick directly.

    <div class="accordian_panel">
        <p>
        I was trained in curriculum development and activity learning at the <a href="https://cfe.unc.edu/" target="blank">Center for Faculty Excellence</a> of the University of North Carolina,
        and I implemented these techniques most extensively in the mathematics topics class, A Climate of Uncertainty. The  
        <a target='blank' href='https://aclimateofuncertainty.web.unc.edu/'>Course website</a> is maintained as a resource to other
        instructors of mathematics and climate to share open curriculum and improve upon the original ideas.

    <div class="accordian_panel">
			<p>This <a href="https://github.com/cgrudz/ADA_compliant_teaching_workflow" target="blank">repository</a> is to document and share my teaching workflow. 
			This workflow has been designed to meet as best as possible ADA web accessibility requirements for science and mathematics.  Particularly, the templates included provide examples
			of my work in creating slides and handouts with rich mathematics that can be read by screen readers.
