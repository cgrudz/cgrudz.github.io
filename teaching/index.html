<h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
<p>
Interdisciplinary learning is a reality in the future of any student pursing applied mathematics, and whether in academia or industry, 
an applied mathematician relies on their communication skills collaborating with experts from other fields.  
To better prepare students academically for their futures, I believe that group work, experimental and case study learning are essential teaching methods to include in the classroom.  
As a supplement to lectures, non-traditional classroom experiences deepen studentsâ€™ understanding,
allowing them to apply theoretical concepts to problems which require more than the repetition of a method.

    <div class="accordian_panel">
        <p>
	<a href="https://github.com/nansencenter/DAPPER" target="blank"><strong>DAPPER</strong></a> is a set of templates and educational tutorials for learning the implementation, and benchmarking the performance, of data assimilation (DA) methods.
        DAPPER reproduces numerical results (benchmarks) reported in the literature, and facilitates comparative studies, thus promoting the reliability and relevance of the results. 
        DAPPER is open source, written in Python, and focuses on readability; 
        this promotes the reproduction and dissemination of the underlying science, and makes it easy to adapt and extend.  
        </p>
        <p>
	I am a coauthor of the data assimilation educational tutorials, collaborating with the lead author <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick_Raanes" target="blank">
	Patrick Raanes</a>.  For questions regarding DAPPER, please contact Patrick directly.

        <p>
        I was trained in curriculum development and activity learning at the <a href="https://cfe.unc.edu/" target="blank">Center for Faculty Excellence</a> of the University of North Carolina,
        and I implemented these techniques most extensively in the mathematics topics class, A Climate of Uncertainty. The  
        <a target='blank' href='https://aclimateofuncertainty.web.unc.edu/'>Course website</a> is maintained as a resource to other
        instructors of mathematics and climate to share open curriculum and improve upon the original ideas.
