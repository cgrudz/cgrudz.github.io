<p>
Interdisciplinary learning is a reality in the future of any student pursing applied mathematics, and whether in academia or industry, 
an applied mathematician relies greatly on their communication skills collaborating with experts from other fields.  
To better prepare students academically for their futures, I believe that group work, experimental and case study learning are essential teaching methods to include in the classroom.  
As a supplement to lectures, non-traditional classroom experiences deepen studentsâ€™ understanding, allowing them to apply theoretical concepts to problems which require more than the repetition of a method.

I was trained in curriculum development and activity learning in the Future Faculty Excellence Fellowship program at the University of North Carolina,
and I implemented these techniques most extensively in the mathematics topics class, A Climate of Uncertainty, in which I designed the 
homework and lectures for the class, and developed a final undergraduate research project.  The course page is maintained as a resource to other 
instructors of mathematics and climate to share open curriculum and improve upon the original ideas.
