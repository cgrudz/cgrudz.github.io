<p>
    My manuscript <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/17M114073X" target="blank">
    "Asymptotic Forecast Uncertainty and the Unstable Subspace in the Presence of Additive Model Error"</a>
    is now in print (open access) in the SIAM/ ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification.  This work extends earlier results of myself
    and collaborators on the dimensional reduction of the uncertainty quantification problem in the Kalman filter to systems with model errors.
    This manuscript also contains an extended survey on the construction of Lyapunov vectors and the interpretation of the Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem, which I
    hope is a useful reference to folks wanting to better understand these tools.
