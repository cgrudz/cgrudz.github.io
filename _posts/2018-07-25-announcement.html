<p>
    Fall Semester 2018 I will be a visitor at <a href="http://cerea.enpc.fr/en/index.html" target="blank">CEREA</a>, a Joint Laboratory of &Eacutecole des Ponts ParisTech/EDF R&ampD.
    Beginning Spring Semester 2019, I will join the <a href="https://www.unr.edu/math" target="blank">University of Nevada, Reno</a> as an assistant professor of statistics.
    I will be taking PhD and Masters students, so please contact me if you are interested in my past or current projects!
