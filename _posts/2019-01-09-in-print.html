    My manuscript <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/17M1138054" target="blank">
    "Structure- and Physics-Preserving Reductions of Power Grid Models"</a>
    is now available (open access) in the SIAM Journal on Multiscale Modeling and Simulation.  This work demonstrates an equivalence between
    the classical Kron reduction for circuit theory with intuitive reductions performed through graph topology, generalizing Kron reduction techniques to
    multiscale power grid networks.  Furthermore, we provide additional physics-preserving reduction techniques, defining nodal clustering
    via triangular configurations.  Visualizations of the real, reduced multiscal network are available on my 
    <a href='https://cgrudz.github.io/research/'>research page</a>.
