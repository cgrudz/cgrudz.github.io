	slides to my presentation</a> at the <a href=https://enkf.norceprosjekt.no/home/enkf-workshop-2021-free-online-event-">2021 International EnKF Workshop</a>.
  This is an early preview of my work in preparation with Marc Bocquet on revising and extending Bayesian ensemble-variational formalism for optimized estimators
	in short-range forecasting applications such as synoptic meteorology.  The manuscript will be submitted shortly for open discussion in
	<a href="https://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/" target="blank">Geoscientif Model Development</a> an open journal of the European Geosciences Union.
