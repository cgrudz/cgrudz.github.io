	<b>Single-iteration Ensemble Kalman Smoother (SIEnKS)</b> is now published in
	<b>Geoscientific Model Development</b></a>. This work extends traditional methods of
  ensemble variational data assimilation with a novel approach, optimized for short-range
	forecast systems.  Our prototype technique is shown both to improve the
	accurracy	and to reduce the leading-order cost of ensemble variational smoothing versus
	traditional	4D approaches.  Further studies will follow to extend the prototype to realistic
	geophysical data assimilation.  This prototype development relied on extensive numerical
	simulation and demonstration with the Julia package

		<b>DataAssimilationBenchmarks.jl</b></a> currently in open review in the
	<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/" target="blank">Journal of Open Source Software</a>.
