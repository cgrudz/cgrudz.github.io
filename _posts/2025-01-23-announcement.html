<p>
  I am happy to announce that I've moved to
  <a href="https://www.sofarocean.com">Sofar Ocean Technologies</a> as a
  Senior Data Assimilation Scientist.  I will be working with the Weather Team
  at Sofar Ocean to develop a global coupled ocean-wave-atmosphere forecast system
  which maximizes the impacts of Sofar Ocean's
  <a href="https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter" target="blank">Spotter Network</a>
  observations.  Our work supports <a href="https://www.sofarocean.com/products/wayfinder" target="blank">
  Wayfinder</a>, the "Google Maps" of Ocean Navigation, and breakthrough data-driven
  modeling of ocean and coastal environments. Oceans First!
