title: SIEnKS in Open Review 
---
<p>
  My work in collaboration with Marc Bocquet on the single-iteration ensemble Kalman smoother (SIEnKS) is now in
	<a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2021-306/" target="blank">open review in Geoscientific Model Development</a>.
	This work derives a novel optimzation of ensemble-variational formalism for short-range forecast applications such as synoptic
	meteorology, and provides extensive numerical benchmark simulation and validation of the method, establishing the performance
	advantages of this technique.  All numerical results are developed in the open-source Julia package
	<a href="https://github.com/cgrudz/DataAssimilationBenchmarks.jl" target="blank">DataAssimilationBenchmarks.jl</a> which is currently
	open review in <a href="https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/3976#issuecomment-994725260" target="blank">The Journal of Open Source Software</a>.
	This work was presented in the <strong>Joint ICTP-IUGG workshop on Data Assimilation and Inverse Problems in Geophysical Sciences</strong>
	with the <a href="https://cgrudz.github.io/research/presentations/ICTP/a_bayesian_approach_to_DA.html">presentation slides linked here</a>.
