title: Lecture notes on Bayesian Data Assimilation in submission
---
<p>
  My lecture notes on data assimilation methodology for the geosciences have been released in a condensed form in the ArXiv
	pre-print <i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07704">A Tutorial on Bayesian Data Assimilation</a></i>.  This tutorial provides
	a broad introduction to Bayesian data assimilation that will be useful to practitioners, in interpreting algorithms and results,
	and for theoretical studies developing novel schemes with an understanding the rich history of geophysical data assimilation and
	its current directions.  This work is currently in submission to a Cambridge University Press collection on 
	<i>Applications of Data Assimilation and Inverse Problems in the Earth Sciences</i>, to appear in 2022.
