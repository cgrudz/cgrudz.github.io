    My manuscript <a href="https://www.nonlin-processes-geophys.net/25/633/2018/" target="blank">
    "Chaotic dynamics and the role of covariance inflation for reduced rank Kalman filters with model error"</a>
    is now in print (open access) in the Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics special issue on 
    <a href="https://www.nonlin-processes-geophys.net/special_issue940.html" target="blank">"Numerical modeling, predictability and data assimilation in weather, ocean and climate: 
    A special issue honoring the legacy of Anna Trevisan (1946-2016)"</a>.  Anna is my academic grandmother and has profoundly shaped my approach to and understanding of 
    data assimilation and dynamical systems.  I am deeply honored to celebrate her life and scientific acheivements in this way.  This special issue contains the contributions of many leading
    geophysicists who have been influenced by Anna's work, and is an excellent issue for a survey on modern issues in data assimilation and predictibility.
